<p>The author, in giving remedial exercises and
diet prescribed to suit the individual need, has
for ten years realized the necessity of a book
which shall give to the homemaker a clear idea
of the uses of foods, that she may be able to
compile her own diets for various blood conditions.
Since the blood is made from food elements,
its conditions can be largely controlled
by a knowledge and regulation of these elements.</p>

<p>The problem of proper nutrition for the
body is as vital as any study affecting the
morals, health, and consequent power of
a nation, since upon the quality and quantity
of food assimilated, depend the sustenance,
health, and strength of its citizens.</p>

<p>The study of life is the most vital interest
in nature. The human race spends
more time in providing nourishment for
the body than in any other line of activity.
Next to nourishment comes self-preservation.
It is intuitive, the infant’s first instinct
is the preservation of life; almost at
once he seeks for nourishment. His body<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
is ever an awakening wonder to him. He
begins his education by a study of his
hands, his legs, and his flesh.</p>

<p>“The physical satisfactions of life, the
joys of mental development, the inspiration
of soul, the sense of growth, of expansion,
and of largest happiness, the self-satisfaction
of greatest usefulness, and the
glorifying results of this usefulness, come
in largest measure only to the person whose
nutriment is proper in quantity, quality,
and form and is taken properly, as to time,
mastication, swallowing, and digestion,
with sufficient exercise to give the body
activity to convert it into use. This enjoyment
of vibrant life is far beyond the joys
of the intemperate or the æsthetic.” That
ones energies of thought may not be constantly
engaged in deciding what is best, it
is important that proper <em>habits</em> be formed.
Habit calls for no conscious energy.</p>

<p>Scientific research along the lines of
electricity, psychology, metaphysics, medicine,
and art has been tenaciously pursued
for centuries; yet scientific study of the
natural means of keeping the body in
health, that the individual may be in physical,
mental, and moral condition to enjoy
and to profit by researches made in other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
lines, has been neglected. The result is,
that man does not enjoy life to the full,
nor make his physical nor mental efforts
yield the best returns.</p>

<p>It is necessary to know the comparative
values of foods as nutrient agents, in order
to maintain our bodies in health and
strength, and with economy of digestive
effort, as well as efficiency. The entire
body,—bone, muscle, blood, brain, nerve,
heat and energy,—is formed from the food
and drink taken into the stomach and from
the oxygen breathed into the lungs; the
mental and physical activity also depends
upon the food. There is no study, therefore,
more important than that of bodily
nutrition and the preparation of food and
drink in right proportions to yield the best
returns under varying conditions,—age,
employment, health, and sickness.</p>

<p>Nutrition is a broad subject. It means
not only that the foods be supplied which
contain elements required to rebuild body
substance and to create heat and energy,
but it embraces, also, the ability of the body
to appropriate the foods to its needs. The
study of nutrition in its full sense, therefore,
must embrace foods, anatomy and
physiology (particularly of the digestive
system), and chemistry, in order to know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
the changes foods must undergo in being
converted into tissue, heat and energy<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>.
This study, reduced to a science, is known
as Dietetics. There is no more important
study for public schools, or for woman’s
clubs.</p>

<p>Nutrition must be solved largely through
chemistry. The health and efficiency of
the individual and of the Nation depend
upon careful study of the chemical components
of foods and the control of the
foods placed upon the market. The
“pound of cure” in the study of materia
medica has been given much thought,—the
“ounce of prevention,” little.</p>

<p>The former custom of employing a physician
as a retainer had its distinct advantage,
his duty being to instruct in right
living so as to <em>avoid</em> disease rather than
to <em>cure</em> it. To-day scientific instruction in
food and hygiene is within the reach of all,
and every mother and teacher is a retainer,
or guard of the health of those in
her charge.</p>

<p>Happily, the United States Government,
realizing that its power as a nation depends
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>upon the strength and health of its citizens,
has established experimental and
analytical food departments. As a result
of the findings of the governmental chemists,
there was enacted in 1906, the Food
and Drug Act, which aims to raise the
standard of food purity, by prescribing
the conditions under which foods may be
manufactured and sold. The law compels
the maker of artificially colored or preserved
food products to correctly label his
goods. The national law was the instigation
of state laws, which have further
helped to insure a supply of pure food
products.</p>

<p>Every particle of body substance is constantly
changing. The new material for
cells and tissues, the substance to supply
the energy needed in the metabolic work
of tearing down and rebuilding, the energy
used in the digestive process of converting
the food into condition to be assimilated,
and the energy used in muscular, brain,
and nerve movement, must all be supplied
by food. Every brain effort in the process
of thinking, every motion, and every muscular
movement requires energy which
the food must supply.</p>

<p>Brain workers, or habitual worriers, use
up force and become thin quite as quickly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
as those whose work is muscular. The
term “brain workers” is commonly applied
to professional men or women,—to
authors, editors, teachers, or to those engaged
in business, but the woman who
manages her household judiciously, or the
woman who spends her life fretting over
existing conditions, or worrying over
things which never happen, uses quite as
much brain force. The difference is that
the former accomplish results outside of
themselves, while the latter simply stirs up
disagreeable conditions within, resulting
in physical ills.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>The whole problem of perfect health and
efficient activity is in keeping the supply
assimilated food equal to the demand, in
keeping a forceful circulation that the
nourishment may freely reach all tissues
and the waste be eliminated, and in full
breathing habits that sufficient oxygen be
supplied to put the waste in condition for
elimination.</em></p>
</div>

<p>The body is certainly a marvelous
machine! It is self-building, self-repairing,
and, to a degree, self-regulating.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p>It appropriates to its use foodstuffs for
growth and for repair.</p>

<p>It eliminates its waste.</p>

<p>It supplies the energy for rebuilding,
and eliminating this waste.</p>

<p>It directs its own emotions.</p>

<p>It supplies the energy for these emotions.</p>

<p>It discriminates in the selection of food
and casts out refuse and food not needed.</p>

<p>It forms brain cells and creates mental
force with which to control the organism.</p>

<p>It keeps in repair the nerves, which are
the telegraph wires connecting the brain
with all parts of the body.</p>

<p>It converts the potential energy in the
food into heat with which to keep itself
warm.</p>

<p>Withal it is not left free to do its
work automatically. It has within it a
higher intelligence, a spiritual force, which
may definitely hamper its workings by getting
a wrong control of the telegraph
wires, thus interfering with the digestion,
the heart action, the lungs and all metabolic
changes. The right exercise of this
higher intelligence, in turn, depends upon
the condition of the body, because when the
mechanism of the body is out of repair it
hampers mental and spiritual control.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
Surely man is marvelously made!</p>

<p>The intelligent care of the body,—the
temple through which the soul communicates
with material conditions,—is a Christian
duty. “The priest with liver trouble
and the parishioner with indigestion, do
not evidence that skilled Christian living
so essential to the higher life.”</p>

<p>Certain it is that improper foods affect
the disposition, retard the spiritual growth
and change the drift of one’s life and of
the lives about one.</p>

<p>Man has become so engrossed and
hedged about with the complex demands of
social, civic, and domestic life, all of which
call for undue energy and annoyance and
lead him into careless or extravagant habits
of eating and living, that he forgets to
apply the intelligence which he puts into
his business to the care of the machine
which does the work. Yet the simple laws
of nature in the care of the body, are
plainer and easier to follow than the complex
habits which he forms. The “simple
life” embraces the habits of eating as well
as the habits of doing and of thinking.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PURPOSES_OF_FOOD">PURPOSES OF FOOD</h2>
</div>


<p>The purposes of food are:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To supply the material of which the
body is made.</p>

<p>To rebuild tissue, which is constantly
being torn down and eliminated.</p>

<p>To produce heat, and to supply
muscular and mental energy.</p>
</div>

<p>Let us discuss these purposes in above
order.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Food
Supply</div>

<p>By food supply is meant not only
that the proper foods in kind and
quantity be eaten, but that the body
be in condition to digest, absorb, and assimilate
the foods, and to eliminate the
waste, otherwise the foods fail to supply
the body needs. It is the nourishment
which the body assimilates and appropriates
to its needs which counts in food economy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>Of the fifteen to twenty substances contained
in foods and comprising the body,
the most abundant are oxygen, hydrogen,
carbon, nitrogen, chlorin, sodium, potassium,
magnesium, iron, calcium, phosphorus,
and sulphur. All living matter,
plant or animal, contains oxygen, hydrogen,
carbon and nitrogen; the difference in
the form and use of the matter is in the
proportions of these elements.</p>

<p>Carbon combined with oxygen forms
carbon dioxid. Hydrogen, nitrogen, and
carbon dioxid form the air. Oxygen and
hydrogen form water. Calcium, iron, magnesium,
sodium, and potassium form the
majority of rocks.</p>

<p>The substances contained in living
organisms are the same as those in inorganic
matter, only in different complexities
as appropriated to each need. This
difference in complexity of combinations
of the same elements in a body is the physical
difference between a living and a non-living
plant or animal.</p>

<p>By far the most important change which
the food must undergo to convert it from
raw material into a state for conversion
into body needs is the chemical change.
While the body needs carbon, it cannot
use coal; it needs nitrogen, yet it cannot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
appropriate it to rebuilding bone and
muscle until, by chemical action with other
elements within, it has been converted into
complex substances called proteins; again,
the chemical action of oxygen breaks down
the proteins.</p>

<p>The muscles, ligaments, and labor-performing
structures contain the largest
amount of proteins; the fats and the carbohydrates
contain the largest amount of
carbonaceous compounds; the brain, the
nerves, and the bones contain the largest
portion of phosphorous compounds; yet,
while the brain contains phosphorus, and
the muscles nitrogen, the brain cannot be
built up by eating elementary phosphorus,
nor the muscles by pure nitrogen, but
compounds rich in phosphorus or nitrogen
may be utilized. It has been demonstrated
by scientific investigation that no
unorganized element is assimilated by the
system and converted into its various
structures.</p>

<p>The gluten of wheat is built up by the
chemical union of nitrogen in the air and
nitrogen in the soil with other substances.
Plants are able to use the simple compounds
of the earth, air, and soil, and,
within their own cells, build them up into
such complex substances as starch, sugar,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
protein, fat, and salt, which are appropriated
by the animal kingdom for further
growth and change.</p>

<p>In its conversion into tissue, heat, energy,
and waste, the importance of the
chemical exceeds the mechanical action,
such as digestion, absorption, assimilation,
and elimination; yet the chemical changes
are aided by the mechanical.</p>

<p>Each individual should know, approximately,
the chemical constituents and the
proportion of these constituents in normal
blood, because from the elements in the
blood, the tissues are constructed. If certain
elements be lacking, the foods containing
these elements in largest proportions
should be supplied until the blood no longer
shows the deficiency. This is Nature’s
method of correction.</p>

<p>Each meal, or each day’s food, may not
contain just the amounts of protein or of
fuel ingredients necessary for that day’s
work and re-supply, but the body is continually
storing material, and this reserve
is constantly being drawn upon to provide
any element which may be lacking in
that day’s supply. Thus, an excess or a
deficiency one day may be adjusted the
next. Healthful nourishment requires that
the balance, as a whole, be kept, and that a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
deficiency or over-supply be not continued
for too long.</p>

<p>Many domestic animals take their food
elements from air and water, as well as
from the compounds which the plants have
formed; while others make use of meat, a
compound formed by another animal. The
digestive forces of the animal has converted
these elements into flesh, a compound
easily assimilated by another.</p>

<p>The greater part of the muscles, nerves,
and glands of the animal kingdom is <em>protein</em>.
The skeleton is composed largely of
deposited salts, while the elements which
supply heat and keep up muscular activity
are <em>starches, fats, and sugars</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>proteins</em> are appropriated by man
from plants, but they are furnished to him
in more easily digested form in lean meat
and eggs, the lower animals having done
much of the work of digestion, converting
the proteins from plant life into more
condensed form. On the other hand, by
access to this concentrated form of easily
digested protein, man is in danger of taking
in too much of this condensed food, if
he eats a large quantity of meat and eggs.</p>

<p>It must be apparent to every thoughtful
person, since the nerves, muscles, and
glands are composed largely of protein<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
and the skeleton largely of salt, that, in
order to furnish the body with the elements
necessary for growth and repair,
these elements must be provided, as
also the substances producing the energy
for the working body. <em>Each individual
should make a self-study to know how
much re-supply is required to renew the
daily waste.</em></p>

<p>About one-third of the food eaten goes to
maintain the life of the body in doing its
incessant work of repairing and rebuilding,
the remaining two-thirds is the reserve for
usefulness outside of itself.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable, and the
least understood of any of the assimilative
and absorptive functions, is that any one
part of the body has the power to appropriate
from the foods the elements
necessary for its own rebuilding, while
these same elements pass through other
organs untouched. The body has the
power, also, to not only make use of the
foods, but to use up the blood tissue itself.
Just how this is done is also a mystery.</p>

<p>There is surely a great lesson in industry
here, and one of the most profound studies
in economics, physics, and chemistry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Heat and
Energy</div>

<p>The second use of foods, as mentioned
before, is to create heat and
energy for the work of the body.
This includes the action of the heart; the
movement of the lungs in breathing; the
digestion, absorption, and assimilation of
food elements; the tearing down and elimination
of waste; and the muscular activity
of body movements.</p>

<p>Just as any engine requires fuel, water,
and air to create the force necessary to run
the machinery, so does the human engine
require fuel, air, and water. The fuel for
the engine consists of coal, wood, or oil.
As these are rapidly brought in combination
with oxygen, combustion, or oxidation,
takes place, liberating heat and setting the
engine in motion. The amount of energy
or force given off by an engine exactly
equals the amount of latent energy provided
in the fuel. Much of this energy is
commercially lost, since much of the latent
force in fuel is not fully liberated, some,
not liberated, going off in the smoke, while
some may remain in the cinders.</p>

<p>Just so in the body,—the amount of heat
and energy given off from the body exactly
equals the amount of latent energy released
by material burned during oxidation.
It is estimated that about one-sixth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
of the heat liberated evaporates through
the skin, the lungs, and through the excreta,
while five-sixths is required to maintain
the body heat.</p>

<p>If the digestive forces are not working
perfectly and if the food is not properly
cooked, some of the food is not made perfectly
soluble for absorption. But in normal
conditions, if the food is supplied in
proportion to the energy required, the heat
and energy given off should exactly equal
the latent heat and energy consumed in
food.</p>

<p>It is to be noted, also, that no force within
the body is lost. In the very process of
the removal of waste, heat and energy are
created, so that the parts no longer needed
are utilized by the system, while they are
being removed from it. Here is a lesson
in economy of force.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, the fuel for the
body consists of <em>fats, starches, and sugar</em>,
which, in combination with oxygen, create
force. The combination of oxygen with
other elements in the body is known as
oxidation. This oxidation liberates heat
and at the same instant produces energy,
either in muscle, gland or nerve. The
muscular energy expresses itself in muscular
motion, the glandular in chemical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
action, and the nervous in nervous energy.
The nervous energy is closely allied to
electrical force.</p>

<p>The <em>starches</em> come largely from cereals
and root vegetables; the <em>sugars</em> largely
from cane, from certain trees, and from
vegetables, fruit, and milk; the <em>fats</em> come
from vegetable oils, from animal fat, as
fat, and some from milk and butter. Some
fats are also formed from proteins.</p>

<p>From the above, it follows that the fuel
value of food depends upon the amount of
fats, starches, and sugars contained.</p>

<p>The exact process of the conversion of
the potential energy latent in food into
heat and energy is not known. It is partly
released during the digestive process, as
the elements of the food come into contact
with the oxygen swallowed and with the digestive
juices. This combustion gives to
the digestive organs the necessary warmth
for their effective work. Digestive juices
will not flow freely when the body is cold.
The heat liberated during the digestive
process is necessary, also, to put the elements
of the food into condition for absorption,
a certain amount of heat being
required for the chemical changes. This
liberated energy is expressed, not alone in
the chemical formation of the compounds,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
but in the peristaltic movements of the digestive
organs.</p>

<p>A small portion of the heat of the body
is gained from the sun or from artificial
heat, but by far the greater part is generated
within the body. If one is cold, the
quickest way to get warm is to generate
more heat within by “turning on the
draught”, or, in other words, by breathing
in more oxygen. So many people cover up
the body with more clothing to reserve the
body heat and forget to generate more heat
by arousing the fires within. This is like
covering up a dying fire to reserve the heat,
instead of turning on the draught to create
more combustion.</p>

<p>Nature provides for a reserve of heat
and energy, above the immediate needs, by
storing up a supply which is called into use
whenever the daily supply is inadequate.
Many hibernating animals store up sufficient
fat in summer to provide heat for
the entire winter. This fat would not last
the winter, however, were the animal
active. Many individuals store up excess
of fat sufficient to last them for months,
even though all fat building elements be
omitted from the diet.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that anything
which creates a greater activity of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
tissues, such as muscular exercise, liberates
a greater amount of heat. The reverse is
also true;—a decrease in the amount of
muscular movement means a decrease of
heat liberated. During exercise, a large
amount of fat, protein, and dextrose
(sugar) are released by the movements and
oxidized; the liberated heat is carried to
all parts of the system and the temperature
is raised. Mental work, for the same reason,
tends to raise the body temperature,
though to a much less degree. Food in the
alimentary canal causes an activity in the
glands of the digestive organs and also
increases the temperature.</p>

<p>Of course, while digestion and mental
and muscular activity are at their height,
the body temperature is highest. These
activities usually reach a maximum in the
afternoon and the temperature is then
highest, while, as a rule, it decreases from
about six at night until four or five in the
morning, when it is usually at its lowest
ebb. This is a point of importance to physicians.
Even five degrees above the average
human temperature, if recorded about
six at night, is not considered abnormal.</p>

<p>Anything which causes an increase in
heat radiation, as perspiration, lowers the
temperature, and the open pores of the skin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
are valuable aids in equalizing the body
heat. A person who perspires freely does
not suffer with heat, during excessive exercise,
as does one whose pores are closed.</p>

<p>One ready means of regulating the body
heat is the <em>bath</em>. If one takes a hot bath,
the temperature is materially raised by the
artificial heat, but there is a recompense in
the increase of heat radiation from the
skin. If one takes a cold bath, the immediate
effect is cooling, but the activity
set up within, to create a reaction, soon
heats the body to a greater degree than
before the bath. The best way to increase
the evaporation and thus decrease the temperature
of the body is with a tepid shower
or a tepid sponge. The tepid water is not
so extreme as to create a strong reaction
and it will cause a marked decrease in temperature.
Thus, for fever patients or for
a warm day, the tepid shower or sponge is
commended; for a cold day, or for the individual
whose circulation is sluggish, the
cold bath is desirable. Where the vitality
is low, so that there is not sufficient reaction,
the bath must be tempered.</p>

<p>Heat generation is also increased by
solid foods that require more than normal
activity on the part of the glands for digestion.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
For this reason the food for fever
patients should be that most easily digested
and should be reduced to the minimum to
keep up the strength.</p>

<p>Diuretic foods and beverages, which increase
the activity of the skin and the kidneys,
also tend to lower the body temperature.</p>

<p>While the elements of the food are being
oxidized, the latent (potential) energy released
by the oxygen creates mental and
physical force and keeps active the metabolic
changing of food into tissues and
cells, also the changing of cells and tissues
into waste.</p>

<p>The young child’s blood circulates freely,
his breathing is unrestricted, the waste of
the system is fully burned up, potential
energy is released, and the result is, he
must be active. The effort of the teacher,
or of those having the care of children
should be, not to restrain the child, but
rather to direct his activity in advantageous
and effective use of his energy.</p>

<p>Scientists have a means of measuring the
energy latent in food material, also the
amount of heat given off in the oxidation of
a given quantity of waste. The unit of
measurement is the calorie,—the amount
of heat which will raise one pound of water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
to four degrees Fahrenheit, or will lift one
ton one and fifty-four hundredths.</p>

<p>Truly the body is a busy work-shop.
Think of the billions upon billions of cells
being formed and destroyed every instant
in the liberation of heat and force! Think,
also, of the necessity of perfect circulation
to bring sufficient blood to the lungs, that
it may gather the oxygen and carry it,
without pausing for rest, to every tissue of
the body! Even in sleep this stream continues
incessantly.</p>

<p>There is also a great lesson here in the
law of supply and demand;—when the body
is at mental or muscular work, the potential
energy liberated leaves through muscle
or brain, as energy, and is expressed in the
result of the work; when the body is at
rest, it leaves it as heat (excepting such
part as is necessary to carry on metabolism,
circulation, etc.) If much muscular
energy is called for, a deep, full breath is
instinctively drawn to supply the oxygen
necessary for the added force required.</p>

<p>If strong mental work is required, attention
should be given to exercise and deep
breathing the while, that the blood may
carry off the waste liberated by brain activity.
The difficulty is that in doing close
mental work, the body is too frequently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
bent over a desk in such a manner as to
restrict the action of the lungs; thus, the
brain worker, in order to continue strong,
mental work, must often go into the open
air,—as he says, “to rest his brain”, but in
reality to re-supply the oxygen required to
carry on his work and to carry away the
waste liberated by brain energy. The
supply for the body work has been called
upon for the undue brain work, and this
lack of oxygen has produced a state of
body designated as “tired.” Until the
necessary oxygen has been supplied, the
brain and body are not balanced, not
“rested.”</p>

<p><em>Nothing is lost in Nature’s distribution
of force and energy. Everything accomplished
in life, either in the physical handling
of material, the brain work in planning
the constructions, the mental movements
of thought in art, literature, or science, are
all representatives of the heat and energy
released from the body, and it is the effort
of every man and woman to make the body
yield as large an income as possible in the
expression of this energy. In order that
it may do so, it must be used with intelligence,
just as any other great machine
must be used intelligently; it must be fed,
exercised, and rested judiciously.</em></p>

<div class="sidenote">Repair and
Elimination
of Waste
(Metabolism)</div>

<p>Every part of the body is constantly
changing. Its work
never stops. If kept in thorough
repair it must be torn down
and rebuilt incessantly. These
chemical changes are called collectively
<em>metabolism</em>. They are divided into two
groups: the chemical process of building
up complex substances from simple ones is
known as <em>anabolism</em>; the chemical process
of oxidizing and breaking down the complex
substances into simple ones, so that
they are in a state to be excreted, is <em>catabolism</em>.
While the process of oxidation in
catabolism is going on, heat and energy are
set free. Most of the chemical changes in
the body are catabolic in character. This
work of tearing down and rebuilding body
tissues never ceases—even in sleep.</p>

<p>It is not enough that the proper foods be
furnished the body in kind and quantity.
The essential thing is that the system be
kept in condition to <em>assimilate</em> the foods to
its needs and to promptly eliminate the
waste. Few people assimilate all of the
foods eaten; nearly every one eats more
than necessary for the body needs.</p>

<p>By <em>assimilation</em> is meant the digestive
process by which foodstuffs are made
soluble and diffusible, so that they can pass<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
into the blood; also, the metabolic activity
by which the food is converted into cells
and tissues.</p>

<p>Nature provides for an incomplete knowledge
of the amount of re-supply necessary,
by enabling the system to carry off a
limited amount of surplus food above the
bodily requirements.</p>

<p>The distinct steps in anabolism are discussed
in the following chapter describing
the work of different organs and the
chemical changes of foods as they come in
contact with the elements in the digestive
juices.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CLASSIFICATION">CLASSIFICATION<br>
OF FOOD ELEMENTS</h2>
</div>


<p>By <em>foodstuff</em> is meant the chemical
elements, appropriated by the animal for
the use of the body, as described above.
By <em>foods</em> is meant those articles of diet
found in the market which contain the
chemical elements used by the body in
various combinations. Bread, for example,
contains all of the foodstuffs and
has been called the staff of life, because
it sustains life. Foods may contain elements,
not foodstuffs, and not used by the
body, but cast out as waste, while certain
foods, such as sugar, cornstarch, olive oil,
and egg albumen, contain only one foodstuff,
as will be noted in the following classification
of foods and foodstuffs—grouped
according to the body uses.</p>

<p>There are many classifications but the
following tables, as compiled by a leading<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
dietitian<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> for his practical work in classes,
are clear and concise.</p>

<p>The above classifications are made
because of the preponderance of certain
elements in them, not because they do not
contain other substances; e.g. vegetables
are mixtures of sugars and starches;
fruits are mixtures of sugars, vegetable
acids, and salts; milk, legumes, cereals,
and nuts contain a more equal division
of sugars, fats and proteins and are therefore
represented as carbo-nitrogenous;
lean meats, with the exception of shell
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>fish, contain no starch, but all meats contain
fat, protein, and water, and all, except
liver, contain ash.</p>

<p>In the table below, examples are given
of foodstuffs in which the chemical
elements are almost pure representatives
of their classes. Cornstarch, sago, and
tapioca are almost pure starch, containing
very little of any other element; glucose,
cane sugar, syrups, and honey are almost
pure sugar; butter, lard, and olive oil are
nearly all pure fat; egg albumen, gluten,
and lean meat are almost pure protein.</p>

<p>The <em>proteins</em> contain nitrogen, sulphur,
and phosphates. The predominance of
nitrogen has given the proteins the name
nitrogenous. The carbonaceous foods<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
contain none of these elements, but are
rich in carbon, hence the name carbonaceous.</p>

<p>As previously stated, no food contains
but one element of foodstuffs and all elements
are formed into compounds of plant
life from the elements in the soil, air and
water by the action of the sun’s rays.
The rays of heat and light seem to store
something of their power in latent heat
and energy within the combinations of
these compounds. The end of plant life is
the completion of its compounds,—it first
generates the compounds, then matures
them, and then dies.</p>

<p>All <em>organic</em> matter is thus formed by the
action of the sun’s rays upon <em>inorganic</em>
matter. All meats are first in the form of
plant life and are converted into other
compounds by the chemical processes of
the animal. This chemical action of the
animal converts the energy latent in the
foods into more concentrated form. The
animal thus performs a part of the chemical
work for man.</p>

<p>The classification of foods, as previously
stated, is based upon the principal organic
foodstuffs contained. Proteins contain
carbon and salts, and carbonaceous foods
contain salts and nitrogen, but these are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
not in appreciable quantity. The preponderance
of these elements determines the
use of the foodstuffs in the body. It will
be remembered that the chief uses are the
production of heat and energy, the building
of new tissue of the growing child, and
the repair of the waste in the child and
the adult.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Water</div>

<p>No one element of food is more important
for the needs of the body
than water. It comprises about two-thirds
of the body weight and is a component
part of all foods. It is composed of
oxygen and hydrogen.</p>

<p>In order that the body may do efficient
work in digestion and in the distribution
of the nutrient elements of the foods, and
that the evaporations from the body may
be re-supplied, the water in the foods,
together with the beverages drunk, should
consist of about seventy-five per cent
liquid to twenty-five per cent nutrient
elements, or about three times as much in
weight as proteins, fats, and carbohydrates
combined. If undue evaporation or
perspiration is occasioned, a larger proportion
is required.</p>

<p>Water passes directly into the circulation
without chemical change. It is being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
constantly evaporated through the lungs
and the skin, and every forty-five seconds
it passes from the kidneys into the bladder.</p>

<p>The average individual at normal exercise,
requires about seventy-one and one-half
ounces of water daily, which equals
about nine glasses (one glass of water
weighs one-half pound); a part of this is
consumed in the food. By reference to the
following tables it will be noted that water
forms a large percentage of all food, particularly
of green vegetables and fruits.</p>

<p>The importance of water for children
must not be overlooked. It is the heat
regulator of the body, and the more energy
used, either in work or in play, which
results in more heat and evaporation, the
more water is required. An animal, if
warm, immediately seeks water.</p>

<p>The body will subsist for weeks upon
the food stored about its tissues; it will
even consume the tissues themselves, but
it would burn itself up without water, and
the thirst after a few days without water
almost drives one insane. It should be
furnished freely, in small quantities at a
time, to fever patients.</p>

<p>Few people, give much thought to its
re-supply; yet they suffer from the loss of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
it, in imperfect digestion and assimilation,
and with kidney and intestinal difficulties,
ignorant of the cause.</p>

<p>Water softens and dissolves the food
and aids in its absorption; it is one chief
agent in increasing the peristaltic action
of both the stomach and intestines, thus
aiding in mixing the food with the digestive
juices and aiding the movement along
the alimentary canal; it increases the flow
of saliva and of digestive juices and aids
these juices in reaching every particle of
food more promptly; it aids in the distribution
of food materials throughout the
body, carrying them in the blood and the
lymph from the digestive organs to the
tissues, where they are assimilated; it
forms a large part of blood and lymph.</p>

<p>The theory has long been held that water
drinking at meals is injurious, the objection
being that the food is not so thoroughly
masticated if washed down with
water, and that it dilutes the digestive
juices. But this theory is not so strongly
held as formerly—in fact, it is now rightly
disputed by the best authorities.</p>

<p><em>When water drinking at meals is allowed
to interfere with mastication and is
used to wash down the food, the objection
is well taken</em>, but one rarely drinks while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
food is in the mouth, the water being taken
at rest periods between mouthfuls. <em>Thorough
mastication and a consequent free
mixing of the food with saliva is one of
the most essential steps in digestion</em>, and
the flow of gastric juice, as the flow of
saliva, is stimulated by the water.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, the food is not
thoroughly masticated, water is most essential
to furnish that which the saliva
would otherwise supply to soak up and dissolve
the food, in order that the gastric
juice may more readily reach all parts of
it.</p>

<p>It is singular that the use of water at
meals has long been considered unwise
when the free use of milk, which is about
seven-eighths water has been recommended.</p>

<p>The copious drinking of cool water from
a half hour to an hour before a meal will
cleanse the stomach and incite the flow of
saliva and gastric juice. Moreover, the
digestive cells secrete their juices more
freely and the sucking villi absorb more
readily when the stomach and intestines
are moderately full, either of food or
water, and to fill the stomach with food
requires too much digestion. The water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
passes through the stomach before the
food.</p>

<p>In building up about seven thousand
thin women, results show that the free
drinking of liquid at meals has a tendency
to put on flesh. Probably one reason for
this is because of the cleanliness and
greater freedom given to the absorbing
and secreting cells of the mucous lining of
the digestive tract, as well as to the
stronger peristalsis.</p>

<p><em>It will be noted that water drinking at
meals has many more arguments in its
favor than against it.</em></p>

<p>One important use to which water is put
is to cleanse the digestive tract and the
kidneys. This cleansing within is more
necessary than the cleansing of the surface
of the body. One cannot form a better
habit than that of drinking two to three
glasses of water upon first arising and
then working the stomach and intestines
by a series of exercises which alternately
relax and contract their walls, causing a
thorough cleansing of these organs.</p>

<p>In case of gastritis, or a catarrhal condition
of the stomach, often a pint of slimy
mucus will collect in the stomach over
night and the cleansing of the mucous lining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
of the digestive tract is then most important.</p>

<p>The drinking of warm (not too hot) or
cold water in the morning depends upon
the condition of the individual. If in good
condition, two to three glasses of cold
water, the vigorous exercises for the vital
organs, and deep breathing of <em>pure</em> air,
followed by a cold bath, will do more to
<em>keep</em> the health, vigor, clear skin, and
sparkling eye than fortunes spent upon
seeking new climates, mineral waters, or
tonics. There is no tonic like water, exercise,
and fresh air, as above prescribed.</p>

<p>Soft water, that is water containing no
lime or other mineral matter, is best for
cooking purposes; hard water, which
causes any degree of curdling of soap, or
a lime crust in the bottom of a tea
kettle, is hard on digestion. Bacterial
germs are killed and much of the mineral
matter deposited by boiling the water. For
drinking purposes it should be aerated
that it may regain its original, fresh taste,
otherwise boiled water tastes flat or insipid.
It may be aerated by filling a jar
half full of water, leaving the other half
for air, and then shaking the water in the
jar so that the air passes through it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>Many claim that one’s thirst, as in the
desire for food, is the only safe guide, as
to the amount and time of drinking, but
these desires are largely matters of habit,
and tastes are often perverted. Unless
the condition is abnormal or the mind becomes
so intensely active that one fails to
listen to the call of nature, the system calls
for what <em>it has been in the habit of receiving</em>
and at the stated times it has been in
the habit of receiving it. The safe method
is to form the habit of eating and drinking
a stipulated amount at regular periods and
not allowing this regular habit to be
broken, unless, for some cause, the system
be out of order, and then the habit should
only be broken for a time.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Salt</div>

<p>Milk furnishes salt in proper proportion
for the baby, and later, when the
child is through nursing, eggs should
be added to the diet of cow’s milk. It
is especially essential that growing children
be furnished milk and eggs that they
may be assured of the proper proportion
and quantity of calcium salts, as these form
the substances of bones and teeth, which
constitute about one-sixth of the body
weight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>All vegetables, fruits, cereals, legumes,
and nuts furnish both calcium salts and
sodium, potassium, and magnesium, which
are the salts used in the blood and lymph.
Minerals are abundant in dried legumes,
(beans and peas). A diet consisting
largely of vegetables needs the addition
of sodium chlorid (common table salt) to
supply sufficient salts for foods; likewise
more salt than is contained in grass and
fodder is needed for animals, particularly
for those producing milk. The scientific
farmer salts his cattle regularly, while
wild animals travel miles and form beaten
paths to springs containing salt.</p>

<p>In rectal feeding, it is known that food
absorbs more readily through the large
intestine if salted. It is probable that salt,
in normal proportions, also aids absorption
in the stomach and small intestine.</p>

<p>Salt should not, however, be used immoderately.</p>

<p>The minerals of the food, or of the body,
form the ashes in burning.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Iron</div>

<p>Iron is an inorganic substance and is
necessary in making red blood corpuscles.</p>

<p>If, by some disturbance in the digestion,
absorption, or assimilation of food, more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
iron is excreted from the body than is
made use of from the food, the blood making
organs do not receive sufficient iron
and the blood is lacking in red corpuscles.
It becomes poor in hemoglobin and the
individual becomes pale. This condition is
known as <em>Anaemia</em>.</p>

<p>Where there are not sufficient red blood
corpuscles, it is of vital importance that
one keep up a good circulation; the stomach,
intestines, liver, and spleen must be
strengthened through exercise and one
must breathe deeply of pure air, for the
red blood corpuscles are oxygen carriers,
and the insufficient supply must do double
duty or the waste of the system will not
be oxidized and eliminated.</p>

<p>A diet rich in iron must be supplied.
It will most often be found that one whose
blood is lacking in hemoglobin and in the
proper proportion of red blood corpuscles,
has had a dislike for the foods rich in iron,
or, perhaps, has not been able to get the
right kind of food.</p>

<p>The yolks of eggs, the red meats (such
as steak, mutton or the breast of wild
game), and the deep colored greens, (such
as spinach, chard, dandelions, etc.) contain
a goodly proportion of iron. The
dark color of greens and of the dark meats<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
is given to them by the iron which they
contain. The dark leaves of lettuce, celery,
and cabbage contain iron, but these
vegetables are apt to be bleached before
being put upon the market.</p>

<p>The yolks of two eggs are better than
one whole egg, as the iron is in the yolk.
A good way to take the yolk of eggs is in
egg lemonade or in eggnog, with a little
nutmeg for spice.</p>

</div>


<p>The carbonaceous foods are those used
by the body for heat and energy and are
so named because they contain a large proportion
of carbon,—heat producing element.
It is the carbon in wood, which,
uniting with oxygen, produces heat and
light.</p>

<p>The carbonaceous foods are all composed
of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen,
the difference being in the different proportions
in which these elements are combined.</p>

<p>They are divided into two classes, Fats
and Carbohydrates. The carbohydrates<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
embrace the sugars and starches and include
such substances as the starches of
vegetables and grains (notably corn, rice,
wheat, and the root vegetables), and the
sugar of milk, of fruits, vegetables, and
the sap of trees. Their chief office is to
create energy. They are almost entirely
absent from meat and eggs, the animal
having converted them into fats.</p>

<p>Carbohydrates are easily digested.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Fat</div>

<p>Fat is the most concentrated form of
fuel and is readily oxidized. It is almost
pure carbon, hence less chemical work
is required to convert it into fuel, but more
oxygen is needed. A pound of fat has
about three times as much fuel value as a
pound of wheat flour, which consists
largely of starch.</p>

<p>Fat forms about fifteen per cent of the
weight of the normal body, and it has about
twice the fuel value of carbohydrates.</p>

<p>Carbohydrates and fats are each composed
of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen,
the difference being that there is less
oxygen in fat, hence, more oxygen from the
air is required for combustion of fat than
for carbohydrates. One pound of starch
requires one and one-fifth pounds of oxygen
for perfect combustion, while one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
pound of suet requires three pounds of
oxygen. For this reason the Eskimo, who
depends largely upon the fats for body
heat and energy, must have plenty of fresh
air. One ounce of fat yields two and one-half
times as much energy as an ounce of
sugar or starch.</p>

<p>If sufficient fat is not consumed, or is not
formed from the carbohydrates (starches
and sugars), a certain portion of the protein
of the body is converted into fat and
used in energy. When the food supply is
short, or much energy is called for, the
surplus supply of carbohydrates is first
used, and, if the carbohydrates are not
sufficient, the proteins are used. Of the
proteins, the gelatinoids are used first, and
next the albuminoids, or tissue builders. If
the demand, either in mental or physical
energy, exceeds the daily supply for a
length of time, the body becomes lean.</p>

<p>In warm weather little fat is needed for
fuel and nature provides fresh, green
vegetables to replace the root vegetables of
the winter, which, consisting largely of
starches and sugars, are readily converted
into heat. In cold weather, especially in
high altitudes or latitudes, more fuel foods
are required to keep the body warm and
more fat is eaten in winter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span></p>

<p>Those who store up an abundance of fat
suffer most from a rise in temperature, because
combustion not only creates heat,
but heat also aids combustion.</p>

<p>Fats are not digested in the stomach.
The connective tissue about the fat is digested
here, and the fat is passed on into
the small intestine, where it is acted upon
by the carbonates and by lipase, one of the
enzymes of the intestinal juices. These
first change the fat into an emulsion and
then into a form of soap and glycerine.
In this saponified form, it is in condition
to be absorbed into the circulation and carried
out to the tissues, where it is assimilated
and used in energy; a similar chemical
change is produced in the conversion
of oil into soap.</p>

<p>Common examples of fats are butter,
cream, the fat of meats and of nuts, and
the oil of grains and seeds,—notably the
cocoanut, olive, and, of the grains, oatmeal.</p>

<p>The fact that more oxygen is required
for combustion of fat than of starches and
sugars is an important item for those who
wish to call upon the fats stored within the
body for daily heat and energy and thus
reduce in weight. If sufficient starches,
sugars, and fats are not consumed in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
food to supply the daily heat and energy
released by exercise, the body calls upon
the sugars and starches temporarily stored
up and, when these have been consumed,
upon the reserve of fat. If much fat is
consumed in the daily food this fat in the
blood will be oxidized before the fat stored
about the muscular tissue. The scientific
reduction of weight, therefore, lies in the
regulation of the supply of starches, sugars,
and fats consumed, and, the oxidation
of more of these substances through
an increase in the daily exercise. Deep
breathing of pure air should accompany
all exercises, to supply sufficient oxygen
for combustion, or oxidation.</p>

<p>Manual laborers require more fat for
energy than do people whose habits are
sedentary. School children, or children
who play hard, should have sufficient fat,
and where fats are withheld, sugar should
be freely supplied.</p>

<p>The supply of fat stored in the body depends
upon the quantity consumed with
the food, upon the quantity used up in heat
and energy, in muscular exercise, or in
mental force. The quantity thus consumed
depends somewhat upon the condition
of the nerves. If the nerves are weak,
they do not properly direct digestion and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
assimilation and less fat is consumed in
the digestive and assimilative processes.</p>

<p><b>Butter and Cream.</b> The fat present in
milk depends, of course, upon the quality
of the milk. There is as much butter fat
in a glass of fresh Jersey milk as in a glass
of cream, which has been separated, by
machinery, from the milk of some other
cows. The cream from some Jersey cows
is almost all butter. Skimmed milk contains
very little fat. If milk is drunk by
the adult, as a means of storing up more
fat within the body, the cream should be
stirred into it.</p>

<p><b>The Fat of Meat</b> should be thoroughly
cooked and cooked with moisture. All
meats in the process of baking or frying
should be covered, in order to retain the
moisture. To make fat easily digestible
it should be well masticated.</p>

<p>Bacon, if fully immersed in its own
grease, in the process of frying, is a common
source of fat and is easily digested.</p>

<p><b>Cod Liver Oil</b> from the liver of the codfish,
is more easily absorbed and assimilated
than any other fat. The odor is not
pleasant and a little lemon juice, salt, baking
soda, or any substance for pungency
and flavor, may be added to make it palatable.
The pure oil taken in this way is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
perhaps preferable to the prepared emulsions.
One has the advantage, at least, of
knowing what he is taking.</p>

<p><b>Olive Oil</b> is crushed from ripe olives.
It is often used where cod liver oil is prescribed,
because more palatable. Cotton
seed oil is often substituted or mixed with
the cheaper grades of olive oil. It is wholesome,
if fresh, but has not the pleasing
flavor of the olive.</p>

<p>Many take olive oil for the purpose of
rounding out the figure with fat. If the
system will assimilate fat, taken in quantities,
the fat may be stored up, but, as a
rule, one is underweight because of a failure
to assimilate the regular diet and the
overloading with fat would not cause a
better assimilation.</p>

<p>Olive oil in moderation is a good food
where much heat and energy are expended,
but if ones occupation is sedentary, much
fat is not required.</p>

<p><b>Nut Oils</b> are good, but, with the exception
of peanut butter, are not often used.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Sugar</div>

<p>The sugars are cane and beet sugar,
maple sugar, and glucose.</p>

<p>All sugars are carbohydrates,—carbon,
hydrogen, and oxygen,—the oxygen and
hydrogen being in the same proportions as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
in water, (two atoms of hydrogen and one
of oxygen), the difference is that the carbon
is missing from the water.</p>

<p>Sugar is said to consist of about ninety-five
per cent nutritive value.</p>

<p><b>Glucose</b> is made by converting the
starch in corn into sugar. It is pure,
wholesome, and cheap, and, for this reason,
it is often used to dilute other sugars.
It is not as sweet as other sugars, and it
ferments more readily. Many of the syrups
on the market are made from it.</p>

<p>The common, granulated sugars are
made from sugar cane or beets; beet sugar
is becoming more generally used.</p>

<p>Brown sugar is granulated sugar in the
early stages of refinement.</p>

<p>Maple sugar is obtained by boiling down
the sap of the maple tree. It is often
adulterated with other sugars or with glucose,
because they are cheaper. This adulteration
does not make it unwholesome,
but when mixed with these it loses its distinct,
maple taste and is more mild.</p>

<p>Before sugar can be used by the human
system, it is changed into grape sugar, or
dextrose, (another form of sugar) by a
ferment in the small intestine called lactose.
Milk sugar needs less chemical change<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
than other sugars and is taken almost at
once into the circulation.</p>

<p>When an excess of sugar is consumed, it
is stored within the body as glycogen, until
required.</p>

<p>Sugar is perhaps a better food than
starch, because less force is required for
its digestion and it is easily assimilated,
being more readily converted into dextrose
than are starches. Moreover it furnishes
the needed heat and energy to organisms
that have no power to digest
starch. Milk sugar is a part of the natural
food for the infant, because the infant
has not developed the ferment necessary
for starch digestion.</p>

<p>Sugar may be oxidized within a few
minutes after eating, and, for this reason,
it is eaten by those who require to use an
undue amount of muscular strength. It
yields heat and energy within thirty minutes
after eating and, in times of great
exertion or exhausting labor, the rapidity
with which it is assimilated gives it
advantage over starch. Used in limited
quantities, therefore, according to the muscular
or brain power exercised, sugar is
one of the best foods for the production
of energy. Where much sugar is eaten
less starch is required.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span></p>

<p>It is also said to prevent fatigue, a man
being able to do seventy-five per cent more
muscular work with less fatigue after consuming
about seventeen and one-half
ounces of sugar dissolved in pure water.</p>

<p>It might be inferred from the above, that
starches could be discarded and replaced
by sugars, but a small quantity of sugar
soon surfeits the appetite and if the foods
were confined to those with a surplus of
sugars, sufficient food would not be eaten
for the needs of the body. This lack of
appetite, occasioned by an excess of sugars,
is due, partly, to the fact that the gastric
juice is not secreted as freely when there
is much sugar in the stomach.</p>

<p>Because of the slower secretion of gastric
juice and the surfeit of the appetite,
sweetened foods are not used at the beginning
of a meal, and, while a moderate
amount of sugar is desirable, a surfeit is
to be deplored.</p>

<p>While sugar is not converted into fat, it
is so readily oxidized and thus supplies
heat and energy so promptly that the
starches and fats are not called upon until
the latent energy in the sugar is used.
Those who wish to reduce in flesh should
eat it sparingly that the starches and fats
may be called upon to furnish energy, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
sugar should be as freely used as the system
can handle it, by those who wish to
build up in flesh.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, about one-fourth of
a pound of sugar, daily, in connection with
other foods, is well utilized by the system,
the quantity depending upon whether one
leads an active or a sedentary life.</p>

<p>Candy is often made from glucose instead
of molasses or cane sugar, and while
glucose is wholesome, it undergoes fermentation
readily. Much candy, unless one
is actively exercising, tends to indigestion.</p>

<p>The desire of the child for sweets is a
natural one, because it uses so much energy,
and sugar supplies this energy with
less effort of the digestive system. When
the child begins to eat more solid foods, if
sugar is used in abundance for sweetening,
it is no longer attracted by the mild
sweetness of fresh milk, and it is well to
cut down the allowance of sugar, when the
child turns against milk, in the hope of
restoring the taste for this valuable food.
Many of the best authorities state that
the child, up to its third year, should never
be allowed to taste sweets, in order that
the appetite may not be perverted from the
natural sweets of milk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p>Sugar is better supplied the child in a
lump or in home-made candy, rather than
in the sweetening of porridge, oatmeal, or
bread and milk, etc.</p>

<p>Sweet fruits, fully ripened, contain much
sugar and should be freely given to the
child. The natural flavor of fruits and
grains is very largely destroyed by sugar,
which is used too freely on many articles
of diet.</p>

<p>Most vegetables and fruits contain
sugar,—indeed sugar is the only nutriment
in many fruits. The sweet taste in all
fruits and vegetables is due to its presence.
Sweet potatoes, beets, carrots, parsnips,
turnips, grapes, figs, and dates are especially
rich in sugar and when these are
furnished with a meal, in any appreciable
quantity, the starches should be restricted—notably
bread, potatoes and rice.</p>

<p>Harvesters, road-makers and others,
who do hard work in the open air, can
consume large quantities of sugar in pie,
pastry, etc., which are difficult to digest,
while one who lives an indoor life, should
refrain from an undue indulgence in these.</p>

<p>For one who is undernourished, sugar is
a desirable food, if the starch be diminished
in proportion as the amount of sugar
is increased; but the inclination in sweetening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
foods is to take more starch than
the system requires, since it is the carbohydrate
foods which are ordinarily sweetened,—not
the proteins.</p>

<p>On account of the latent heat and energy,
sugars are more desirable in cold
weather than in warm. Nature supplies
them more abundantly in root vegetables
for this season. More puddings and
heavier desserts are eaten in winter.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Starch</div>

<p>Starch is one of the most important
carbohydrates used for nutrition.
It is formed by the chemical action
produced by the sun’s rays upon the cells
of living plants, from the carbon-dioxid
and water in the air and in the soil.</p>

<p>Corn starch, sago, tapioca, and arrowroot
are practically pure starch. Cornstarch
is from young maturing corn; tapioca
is from the meal of a tropical plant,
cassava; sago is from the pith of the sago
palm; arrowroot is from a plant of the
same name, a native of the West Indies.
Rice is almost pure starch, while wheat
and other cereals contain from sixty to
seventy per cent.</p>

<p>Starch lacks flavor and for this reason
all starchy foods are seasoned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

<p>All starches must undergo much chemical
change by action of the saliva, the intestinal
juice and by the liver, before they
can be used by the body. They are first
converted into dextrine and then into maltose
(animal sugar). The digestion is
begun by the saliva in the mouth and continued
in the stomach by the saliva swallowed
with the food. If the saliva fails to
digest all of the starch, either in the mouth
or the stomach, it passes unchanged into
the intestines, where it is converted by the
amylase of the intestinal juice, first into
dextrine and then into maltose, or sugar.
It is absorbed into the blood as sugar.
After the digested starch (maltose) passes
into the blood it is spoken of as sugar. Before
it is converted into energy it is again
changed in the liver into animal starch
(glycogen) and stored for a time in the
liver. When the system is ready for it,
it is again broken down into sugar, because
in the form of glycogen it cannot be absorbed
into the blood.</p>

<p>The chemical process used in the formation
of glucose, from the starch in corn, is
allied to the change in the liver, from
starch into sugar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>The starches and sugars are really the
“reserves” or “go-betweens” of the body,
being stored until needed.</p>

<p>If starches are consumed in unduly large
quantities, without sufficient exercise to
burn them up, they overload the liver and
clog the system.</p>

<p>Starchy foods should not be given to
children before the starch converting ferments
are formed, nor to one in disease
where these ferments are interrupted.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="Nitrogenous_Foodstuffs">Nitrogenous Foodstuffs
or Proteins</h2>
</div>


<p>The proteins form heat and energy when
the supply of sugars, starches, and fat
are exhausted, but proteins, alone form
muscle, bone and sinew. They are, in this
sense, the most important of foods,—they
are, also, the most costly.</p>

<p>The foods most rich in proteins are meat
and eggs. These have undergone chemical
changes from the vegetable kingdom
being built up into more complex compounds
in the animal kingdom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>Meat and eggs are the tissue builders.
In this connection it may be well to state
that blood is tissue; thus meat and eggs
build the blood, as well as muscle and
sinew.</p>

<p>Nitrogenous foods, or proteins, are so
called because of the large proportion of
nitrogen which they contain. All nitrogenous
foods contain considerable carbon—mostly
in the form of fat in the meat
elements—but the carbonaceous foods contain
so little of the proteins that they do
not appreciably enter into the nutrition,—the
carbon and nitrogen in the carbo-nitrogenous
foods are more equally divided.</p>

<p>The nitrogenous or protein elements in
the body constitute about one-fifth of its
weight. They make the framework, forming
the basis of blood, lymph, muscle,
sinew, bone, skin, cartilage, and other
tissues.</p>

<p>Worn out body tissues is constantly
being torn down and eliminated and the
protein in the foods must daily furnish
material for repair, as well as for building
new tissue in the growing child.</p>

<p>A young animal’s first need is for
growth, not having learned to exercise sufficiently
to use much energy, and the first
food given is an animal product—milk to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
babes and other mammals, while the young
of other animals are first fed upon eggs.</p>

<p>The nitrogenous foods are required in
smaller bulk than vegetables and fruits;
they are more concentrated and contain
less waste. According to recent experiments,
the average adult requires from two
to four ounces a day of nitrogenous foods,
to repair the waste, according to the proportion
of nitrogen contained. Happily,
where more is consumed, the system has
the power, up to a certain limit (depending
upon the physical condition and the daily
activity), to eliminate an excess. It is
needless to say that if the daily waste is
not re-supplied, the digestion and bodily
nutrition suffer. The system <em>must</em> have
the two to four ounces to supply the nitrogen
daily excreted, or the tissues themselves
will be consumed.</p>

<p>The proteins, of which meat is the principal
one, are classified as</p>

<p>Albuminoids:—albumin (white of eggs),
casein (curd of milk), myosin (the basis
of lean meat and gluten of wheat),</p>

<p>Gelatinoids, (connective tissue of meat),</p>

<p>Extractives (appetizing and flavoring
elements).</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="DIGESTION">DIGESTION</h2>
</div>


<p>Any discussion in regard to the digestibility
of foods must be general, because
food which agrees with one may disagree
with another, and a food which disagrees
with one at a particular time may entirely
agree with him at some other time; therefore,
before one passes upon the adaptability
of a food to the individual, it should be
known that this food agrees or disagrees
with him under varying conditions.</p>

<p>The digestibility of food depends largely
upon the physical condition of the
individual, because the amount of digestive
juices poured into the alimentary canal is
influenced by this condition, particularly
by the condition of the nerves. If sufficient
juices, in proper proportions, are not
poured into the digestive tract, the foodstuffs
are not made soluble for absorption
into the blood. Digestion is practically
synonymous with solution,—all solid foods
must be reduced to a liquid state, through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
digestive juices and water, before they can
pass through the walls of the stomach and
intestines.</p>

<p>Each individual should <em>learn to like</em> the
foods containing the nutrient elements
which experience and blood tests have
shown to be lacking in his case. The question
of likes and of dislikes in regard to
foods, is largely habit, and one can learn
to like almost any food one wishes.</p>

<p>Where one forms the habit of discriminating
too much in the food, or discarding
this food or that, because at some time it
has disagreed, due to the particular condition
at the time, the mind approaches the
table as a more or less pessimistic censor
and the saliva and the gastric juices are
retarded in their flow.</p>

<p>When one is exercising freely, so that the
muscular and mucous coats of the digestive
system are strong, the body will handle
foods which, during sedentary habits, it
would not digest. There are kinds of
foods, however, which, to certain individuals,
according to the chemical composition
of the body, act as actual poisons, e. g.,
strawberries, cheese, or coffee.</p>

<p>It may be well to here trace, briefly, the
progress of the food through the digestive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
tract and the action of the juices and the
ferments upon it.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Salivary
Digestion</div>

<p>The food in the mouth is mixed with
saliva, which dissolves the starches,
converting them into sugar. The starches
are the only foods whose chemical digestion
is begun in the mouth. They are
first broken up into dextrin and then into
the more simple sugar, known as animal
starch, or <em>maltose</em>. Hereafter, in speaking
of sugar, after it has been absorbed into
the blood, the reader will bear in mind that
the term refers not only to digested sugar,
consumed as such, but also to digested
starches (maltose), as shown on page <a href="#Page_63">63</a>.</p>

<p>It is important that sufficient saliva be
mixed with the food, through mastication,
that it may enter the stomach and there
continue the chemical process of digestion
of starch. If starches are not thoroughly
masticated, sufficient saliva will not enter
the stomach to convert the starch into
sugar; the food will pass into the small
intestine, which must then do more than
its normal work of digestion.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></p>
<p>The saliva consists of about ninety-nine
and one-half per cent water and one-half
per cent solids. The solids consist of
ptyalin, sodium chlorid, sodium carbonate
(baking soda), mucus, and epithelium.
Ptyalin, the most important of these, is an
active digestive agent; the mucus lubricates
the masticated food; the sodium carbonate
insures the alkalinity of the food;
the salt is present in all secretions; and the
water dissolves the food that the juices
may more readily reach and act upon each
particle.</p>

<p>The saliva flows into the mouth, more or
less, at all times, but more copiously during
mastication. Its evident purpose, when
food is not present, is to keep the lining of
the mouth moist.</p>

<p>The flow of saliva is controlled, to a
great degree, by nerves which have their
centers in the medulla oblongata. The
sight of food, pleasingly served, or even
the thought of food which one likes, will increase
the salivary flow. This is one instance
of the control of thought materially
affecting digestion, and the importance of
<em>forming the habit of cultivating a taste for
all kinds of food</em>, is apparent. The
stronger the relish for the food, and the
more thoroughly it is masticated, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
mixed with the saliva, the more perfect will
be the first step in digestion. This first
step of thorough mastication is all important,
not only because the chemical
action upon the starch molecules is
facilitated by the thorough softening and
mixing with the saliva, but thorough mastication
also tends to prevent overeating.</p>

<p>Water encourages the flow of saliva and
for this reason should be drunk copiously
before meals, particularly where digestion
is weak. It may also be taken at rest
periods during the meal. (See page <a href="#Page_44">44</a>).</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Stomach
Digestion</div>

<p>As the food enters the stomach, the
gastric juice pours out from the
mucous lining, very much as the saliva
pours into the mouth. It consists of
ninety-nine and one-half per cent water
and one-half per cent solids, as does the
saliva. The solids of the gastric juice are
composed of pepsin, rennin, hydrochloric
acid, and mucus. The mucus serves to
lubricate the food as in the saliva. It also
prevents the digestion of the mucous lining
of the stomach itself.</p>

<p>The hydrochloric acid and the pepsin
cause the principal chemical changes in the
food while in the stomach, acting alone
upon the proteins. The only digestion of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
starches in the stomach is that continued
by the saliva. The salivary digestion proceeds
until the gastric juice is secreted
in sufficient quantity to cause a marked
acidity of the stomach contents, when the
starches are passed into the intestines.</p>

<p>Gastric juice begins to flow into the
stomach soon after eating, but it is not
secreted in sufficient quantity to supersede
salivary digestion for from twenty to
forty-five minutes.</p>

<p>The result of gastric digestion of proteins
is their conversion, first, into albumin,
then into proteosis and, lastly, into
peptone, which is protein in a more simple,
soluble, and diffusible form. In the form
of peptone, the proteins are in condition to
be absorbed.</p>

<p>If the food has been properly cooked and
masticated the gastric digestion will be
completed in one and one-half to three
hours. If not properly cooked and masticated,
the stomach digestion may continue
one to two hours longer. It should,
however, be completed in three hours.</p>

<p>The most readily digested animal foods
remain less time in the stomach. Meat,
as a rule, is easily digested, because
the action of the digestive juices of the
animal has converted the starches and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
sugars. The white meat of chicken, being
soft, is digested in a shorter time than the
red or the dark meat.</p>

<p>Fluids leave the stomach more rapidly
than solids. Seven ounces of water leave
the stomach in one and one-half hours,
seven ounces of boiled milk in about two
hours.</p>

<p>The flow of gastric juice, as the flow of
saliva, is governed by the nerves;—the
sight, taste, and smell of food, and the
attitude of mind toward it, to a certain
extent, regulates its flow.</p>

<p>After the food has extensively accumulated,
during the progress of a meal, the
stomach begins a series of wave-like movements
called peristaltic waves.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> These
waves work downward through the length
of the stomach towards its lower opening,
known as the pyloric orifice. As the food is
moved down the stomach by these motions,
it is thoroughly mixed with the gastric
juice.</p>

<p>During the early stages of digestion,
the sphincter muscles of the pylorus keep
the lower end of the stomach closed,
but, as digestion progresses, the pylorus
gradually relaxes to let the digested,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>soluble portion of the food pass into the
intestine. If the food still remains in a
solid form, by reason of being improperly
cooked or poorly masticated, as it touches
the pylorus, these sphincter muscles, almost
as if they were endowed with reasoning
faculties, close, forcing the undigested
mass back to be further acted upon by the
gastric juice,—the solid mass is not
allowed to pass until dissolved.</p>

<p>If the individual continues to abuse the
stomach and to cause it to work overtime,
it becomes exhausted and demands rest; it
refuses to discharge the gastric juice in
proper proportion; the peristaltic movements
are weak; and food is not promptly
or forcefully moved along the stomach and
mixed with the gastric juice. This demand
for a rest is termed <em>Indigestion</em>.</p>

<p>To sum up,—digested sugar is dextrose;
digested starch is first dextrin, then maltose
(animal, sugar); digested protein is
peptone; and, digested fat is saponified
fat.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Intestinal
Digestion</div>

<p>The food passes from the stomach,
through the pylorus into the small
intestine. The first twelve inches of the
small intestine is known as the duodenum.
In the duodenum it is acted upon by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
the pancreatic juice from the pancreas, the
bile from the liver, and the intestinal juices.
These juices act upon proteins, fats, and
carbohydrates. The bile acts upon the fats,
while the pancreatic and intestinal juices
act chiefly upon the carbohydrates.</p>

<p>As the food enters the intestine, it is
changed, by the sodium carbonate, from
the acid condition produced in the stomach,
to alkaline reaction.</p>

<p>The bile exercises an important influence
upon digestion, any disturbance in the flow
of this greenish-brown secretion being very
quickly shown both in stomach and intestinal
digestion. It emulsonizes and
saponifies the fats, it aids in their absorption,
and it lubricates the intestinal mass,
facilitating its passage through the entire
length of the intestines. Thus, it is a very
potent agent in regulating the bowel movements.
A diminution in the flow of bile
quickly expresses itself in constipation.</p>

<p>Fats are almost entirely digested in the
small intestine. The presence of fat stimulates
the flow of pancreatic juice, which,
in turn, stimulates the flow of bile from
the liver. For this reason, if the liver is
sluggish, fatty foods are desirable. Olive
oil is prescribed for gall stones to stimulate
the action of the bile ducts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span></p>

<p>Before the fat molecules can be absorbed,
they must first be broken up into glycerin
and fatty acids and further changed to a
fine emulsion, which gives the contents of
the small intestine a milky appearance.
After they are broken up into these fatty
acids and thus brought to the finest state
of emulsion, they are readily saponified,
being then soluble in water and in a state
to be absorbed by the walls of the intestines.
The fats are absorbed almost entirely
in the small intestine,—mostly in
the duodenum.</p>

<p>As a rule, the starches, or dextrin, will
not be fully digested by the saliva and
those which have failed of salivary digestion
are acted upon by amylase (one of the
solids of the intestinal juice) and changed
to maltose, while the trypsin from the pancreas,
together with the intestinal juice,
acts upon any protein which has failed to
be fully digested in the stomach, changing
it into peptone. In the form or peptone it
is absorbed through the “sucking” villi of
the intestinal walls.</p>

<p>The food is forced along the intestinal
tract by peristaltic or muscular relaxation
and contraction waves, as in the stomach.
As it is so forced, the nutrient elements,
after being put into condition for absorption,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
are taken up through the villi of the
intestinal walls by the portal veins and the
lacteals of the sub-mucous lining. (See
page <a href="#Page_78">78</a>).</p>

<p>It is now believed that a larger proportion
of food is digested and absorbed
than was heretofore realized, and that the
excretions from the intestines are, in
many cases, made up almost entirely of refuse,
and of the catabolic waste of the
system. In an ordinary, mixed diet, it is
stated that about ninety-two per cent of the
proteins, ninety-five per cent of the fats,
and ninety-seven per cent of the carbohydrates
are retained by the body.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>In digestion, it is of the utmost importance
that the muscular, mucous, and the
sub-mucous coats, and the secreting glands
of the stomach and intestines be kept
thoroughly strong and active, that the
digestive juices may be freely poured out,
the nutriment be freely absorbed, and the
food be moved along the digestive tract.
The strength of any organ is gained
through the nutriment in the blood; therefore,
daily exercise, which calls the blood
freely to these organs, is imperative.</em></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>


<div class="sidenote">Absorption
of Food</div>

<p>The greater part of the food is
absorbed through the intestines, yet
some proteins, which have been fully
digested by the gastric juice, and certain
fats, particularly the fats in milk, which
are in a natural state of emulsion, may be
absorbed through the walls of the stomach.
However, the absorption through the stomach
is small compared to that through the
intestines.</p>

<p>The small intestine is particularly fitted
for absorption. Every inch or so along its
course the mucous lining is thrown up into
folds, as if to catch the food as it passes
toward the large intestine, and to hold it
there until the villi have the opportunity
to absorb it. These transverse folds of the
intestinal walls are called valvulæ conniventes.
The villi are fingerlike projections
of the mucous lining of the
intestines, which stand out upon the lining
somewhat as the nap on plush. They
have been called “sucking” villi, because
during the movements of the intestines
they seem to suck in the liquid food. As
soon as the foodstuffs,—proteins, carbohydrates,
and fats, are put in a dissoluble
state ready for absorption, they are very
promptly absorbed by the villi. If, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
any reason, they remain unabsorbed, they
are liable to ferment by the action of the
trypsin, or to be attacked by the bacteria
always present in the intestines.</p>

<p>The peptones, sugars, and saponified
fats are rapidly absorbed, while the undigested
portion, together with the unabsorbed
water, the bile, mucus and
bacterial products, are passed through the
ileo-cecal valve into the large intestine.</p>

<p>That the large intestine is also adapted
to the absorption of fats is shown by
clinical experiments with patients who cannot
retain food in the stomach, the food in
such cases being given through rectal injections.</p>

<p>In the large intestine, the mass passes up
the ascending colon, across the transverse
colon, and down the descending colon,
losing, by absorption, foodstuffs not absorbed
in the stomach and small intestine.</p>

<p>While water and salt are absorbed both
in the stomach and in the small intestine,
the evident purpose in leaving the larger
part of the water to be absorbed in the
large intestine is that it may assist the
intestinal contents in passing along. The
water also stimulates the peristaltic movement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span></p>

<p>As the food is absorbed through the
walls of the alimentary canal, it is picked
up by the rootlets of the mesenteric veins<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
and by the lymph channels,—the latter,
through the abdominal cavity, are called
lacteals. Nearly all of the fats are absorbed
through the lacteals. The whitish
color given to the contents of the lacteals,
by the saponified fats, gives rise to the
term lacteal, meaning “whitish.”</p>

<p>Nearly all of the proteins and sugars
pass through the mesenteric veins and
the portal veins into the liver. Here the
sugars are at once attacked by the liver
cells and built up into glycogen as described
on page <a href="#Page_81">81</a> and the proteins are
passed through the liver into the arterial
blood stream. A small portion of the proteins,
however, do not go to the liver, but
are passed directly into the lymphatics and
thus into the blood stream, where they are
again carried to the liver.</p>

<p>To sum up,—the larger part of the absorption
of sugars, starches, proteins, and
fats is through the small intestine, though
some are absorbed in the stomach and a
very little through the large intestine;
while some water and salts are absorbed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>in the stomach and small intestine, these
are largely absorbed in the large intestine.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="The_Work_of_Various_Organs">The Work of Various Organs
Affecting Digestion</h2>
</div>


<p>The purpose of this chapter is to show
the work of other organs than the digestive
organs in converting the digested
food to use in the body, in tearing down
waste, and in eliminating waste and an excess
of material above the body needs.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Work of
the Liver</div>

<p>The liver is commonly called the
chemical work-shop of the body. The
proteins and sugars are carried
through the blood (portal veins) to the
liver directly they are absorbed from the
alimentary canal. As the food materials
filter through the blood capillaries, between
the liver cells, several substances are absorbed,
particularly sugar, which is here
changed into animal starch called <em>glycogen</em>.
It is held in the liver for a few hours in the
form of glycogen and then redigested by
the action of an amylolitic ferment and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
again gradually given out into the blood in
the form of sugar; hence sugar is subject
first to the anabolic change of being built
up into glycogen, and then to the catabolic
change of oxidation and breaking down.</p>

<p>While the conversion of the sugar is
one chief office of the liver, it also acts
upon the proteins,—not as they are first
passed through the liver in the blood, but
as they are returned to the liver from the
muscle tissue, partly oxidized and broken
up into simpler products. The liver cells
absorb and further oxidize and combine
them into nitrogenous waste, which the
kidneys throw off in urea.</p>

<p>The liver and the spleen also break up
the pigment or coloring matter of the red
blood corpuscles. As they become worn
out, they are retired in the liver and the
spleen from the circulation. The iron is
retained by the liver cells and the remainder
is thrown off from the liver, in
the bile.</p>

<p>The liver is often called the watch dog of
the body, because it is on guard for all
poisons which pass through it in the blood.
The large part of these toxic substances are
absorbed through the alimentary canal
with other foodstuffs. Many of them are
the result of the fermentation of foods<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
which are not digested as promptly as they
should be, on account of an insufficient
secretion of digestive juices, or a failure to
secrete them in normal proportions, or due
to inactivity of the stomach and intestines.</p>

<p>It surely is a wise provision of nature to
supply a guard to oxidize, or break down
these poisons and make them harmless, so
that they do not pass to all parts of the
body as poisons, thus affecting the nerves
and the blood stream, and, through these,
the entire system.</p>

<p>The necessity of correct habits of deep
breathing will be readily seen, because
oxygen is required to break down the
poisons as well as to oxidize the waste of
the system.</p>

<p>One example of the action of the liver
in rendering substances harmless, is its
oxidation of alcohol. From one to three
ounces of alcohol a day are oxidized and
made harmless in the liver, varying according
to the individual and to the condition,
at different times, in the same person.
If the limit of one to three ounces is
exceeded, the excess is not oxidized and intoxication
results. These evidences of intoxication
are in the nature of narcosis;
<em>alcohol is now regarded as a narcotic along
with ether and chloroform</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span></p>

<p>It was formerly held by physiologists
that alcohol was a food, because its oxidation
liberates body heat and it was assumed
that this liberation of heat, was the same
as that freed by the combustion of fats,
starches, and sugar uniting with oxygen.
More recent knowledge, however, has unquestionably
determined that heat, resulting
from oxidation of alcohol, does not
keep up body temperature; the pores of the
skin are opened and there is a greater
loss of heat through the skin. This really
makes the system less able to resist cold.
Large doses of alcohol actually cause a
fall in body temperature and every force of
the body is decreased in efficiency, while if
alcohol were an actual food the efficiency
would be increased. We are forced to the
conclusion, therefore, that alcohol is a
<em>pseudo-food</em> as it is a <em>pseudo-stimulant</em>.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Work of the
Muscles</div>

<p>The muscles play an important
part in the use of foods. Most of
the heat is generated in them, by
the sugar and fats coming in contact with
the oxygen in the blood. This heat is liberated
during every moment of the twenty-four
hours, asleep or awake. Of course,
more is liberated during exercise, since the
movement of the muscles sets all tissues<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
into activity and the blood circulates more
strongly, bringing a greater supply of
oxygen to them. It is always well during
active exercise to stop frequently and fully
inflate the lungs. The effort should
always be made to breathe fully and
deeply—otherwise the pressure of the
liberated carbon dioxid will cause a pressure
throughout the blood stream, particularly
about the heart and in the head.
This pressure is relieved when the excess
of carbonic acid gas liberated has been
thrown off by the lungs. Nature makes
the effort to throw off the excess of carbonic
acid gas by forcing one to breathe
more rapidly while running or taking unusual
exercise.</p>

<p>The oxidation changes are simply a
combustion of sugars and fats, liberating
latent heat as they are brought into
contact with the oxygen. Exercise and a
regulation of the amount of carbohydrates
and fats consumed in the foods is the
natural, scientific method for the reduction
of an excess of fat.</p>

<p>A certain amount of protein is constantly
oxidized in the muscles, also, being
broken down into carbon dioxid, water and
a number of nitrogenous mid-products.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
The carbonic acid gas and water are
thrown off by the lungs and the partially
oxidized, nitrogenous waste is carried to
the liver, where it is further oxidized and
prepared for excretion, through the kidneys,
lungs, skin and intestines.</p>

<p>When sugar is carried to the muscles in
larger quantities than can be utilized by
them, it is often built up into animal
starch and stored in the form of glycogen,
similar to its chemical change and storage
in the liver.</p>

<p>This storage of glycogen in the muscles
and in the liver is a wise provision of Nature.
It is a reserve to be called upon
whenever the expenditure of heat and
energy exceeds the amount supplied in any
day’s rations.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Work of the
Nerves</div>

<p>The nerves oxidize food materials,
but not to any great extent, excepting
during nervous activity.
During periods of rest, food materials are
stored in the nerve cells in grandular form.
They represent concentrated nerve foods
and are the result of anabolic processes.
During nervous activity they are oxidized
and carried away through the blood and
the lymph. This oxidation of the food,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
stored in the nerves, creates nervous
energy and heat.</p>

<p>The energy liberated by the nerves resembles
electrical energy.</p>

<p>Where one subjects himself continuously
to an excess of nervous activity, all
reserve food material, stored in the nerve
cells, is used and the result is a trying
nerve tension. Such individuals need
plenty of easily digested food.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Work of the
Lungs</div>

<p>The lungs absorb oxygen and
eliminate carbon dioxid. They
occasionally throw off a very
little organic material.</p>

<p>The carbon dioxid is carried to the
lungs from the tissues through the venous
stream and diffused through the capillary
walls of the lungs. The oxygen is absorbed
into the capillaries through the thin
air sacs in the walls of the lungs.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Work of the
Kidneys</div>

<p>The kidneys do not absorb as do
the lungs, neither do they perform
any anabolic work as does the
liver, nor catabolic work as the muscles,
nerves and the liver. They simply throw
off waste matter.</p>

<p>The blood passes through them in a
transverse branch from the abdominal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
aorta. In its circuit urea, uric acid,
urates, sulphuric acid, sulphates and
sodium phosphates pass from the blood
with the water and are thrown from the
system; hence the kidneys are purifying
organs, as are the lungs. The blood
returning from the kidneys through the
veins is pure, just as the blood in the
pulmonary vein is pure, while that in the
arteries to the kidneys and the lungs is
impure.</p>

<p>The above substances cannot be thrown
off from the lungs. They are the products
of oxidation of proteins, partly of
the living tissues and partly those broken
down direct as they are supplied in the
foods, in excess of the needs of the system.</p>

<p>Interference in the action of the kidneys
results in a hoarding of these substances
in the blood, and may produce an
intoxicated condition known as uremic
poisoning.</p>

<p>Water in abundance and diuretic fruits
and vegetables, which increase the activity
of the kidneys, should be taken where
uremia is indicated. (Foods which cause
a free flow of urine are called diuretic
foods.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span></p>


<div class="sidenote">Work of the
Skin</div>

<p>The sweat glands also throw off an
excess of water and salts. The
kidneys and the skin are interdependent;
if the kidneys are inactive the
skin throws off a larger quantity and if the
skin is inactive, or if for any reason the
pores of the skin are closed, the kidneys
are more active. This is evidenced by the
sudden immersion of the body in cold
water; the pores of the skin being closed
the kidneys immediately act.</p>

<p>During the summer, or at any time when
the skin throws off more water than usual,
the kidneys are less active and the urine,
being more concentrated, is darker.</p>

<p>The skin also throws off carbon dioxid
and, to a slight extent, it absorbs oxygen.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Work of the
Intestines</div>

<p>The intestines, in their work of
elimination, pass off all undigested
matter. They also carry off bile
pigment, bile salts, mucus, amino acids,
and other decomposition of proteins,—also
a little unabsorbed fats and bacterial decomposition
taking place in the intestines.
Coarse articles of food containing fibres
which do not digest, such as the bran of
grains and the coarser fruits and vegetables
(though much of their substances are
not food in the strictest sense) are valuable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
to increase the peristaltic movements
of the intestines and to act as a carrying
body to move the waste excretions along
their course.</p>

<p>The combustion, or burning of fuel in
any form, (oxidation for the release of
latent heat and energy) always leaves
some parts which are not used as heat or
energy, and it is the work of the intestines
to eliminate much of this refuse. When
coal is burned, gas, smoke and cinders or
clinkers, constitute the waste and if these
were not allowed to escape from a stove
the fire would soon go out—the smoke and
gas would smother it and the clinkers
would prevent the circulation of oxygen
and soon clog and fill the stove. The same
is true in the body—the carbonic acid gas
not being allowed to pass off would soon
put out the fires of life; it would poison
the body and stunt the action of the
nerves. If the nitrogenous waste (like
ashes and cinders) is not eliminated by the
kidneys, one will die in convulsions in one
or two days.</p>

<p>The absolute necessity of a free elimination
of waste will be readily seen.—If
the engine is to do its best work, the
engineer sees that it is kept perfectly
clean—otherwise it becomes clogged, does<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
inefficient work and the clogging soon
wears out some parts. The same is true
in the body,—clogging in any part overworks
and wears out other parts dependent
upon the work of the one.</p>


<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Let us sum up the processes which the
food undergoes in its conversion into condition
to be absorbed by the body; in its
absorption through the walls of the
intestines and stomach; and the metabolic
processes which it undergoes in being
converted into heat and energy and again
broken down and eliminated as waste.</p>

<p><em>The Saliva</em> begins the digestion of
starches and sugars in the mouth. This
digestion is continued by the saliva in the
stomach.</p>

<p><em>The Stomach</em>, when in normal condition,
thoroughly digests the proteins. If any
proteins fail of digestion in the stomach
the process is completed in the intestines.</p>

<p>The <em>Intestines</em>, aside from their work of
digestion and absorption, excrete bile pigment,
bile salts, animal acids, mucus and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
other decomposition of proteins, with
bacterial fermentation and putrefactions;
also such food materials as are not
digested.</p>

<p>The small intestine digests and absorbs
the fats and continues the digestion of
starches, sugars and fats when this digestion
is not completed in the stomach.</p>

<p>The large part of the food is absorbed
through the small intestine, though a small
part is absorbed through the walls of the
stomach and through the large intestine.</p>

<p>Fats are almost entirely absorbed in
the small intestine. They are absorbed
through the lacteals and are carried into
the blood stream.</p>

<p><em>The Liver.</em> The proteins and the
starches (converted into maltose) and
sugars pass into the liver. The sugar (including
the sugar in vegetables, milk, fruits
and that used for sweetening, as well
as the carbohydrates which have been
changed into maltose), is converted into
glycogen in the liver, stored here for a
time and again broken down into sugar
that it may be in condition to be absorbed
into the blood.</p>

<p>The proteins pass through the liver but
are not acted upon by this organ until
they again return to the liver through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
blood stream, after they have been partly
oxidized in the tissues. The liver further
oxidizes them putting them into condition
to be excreted by the kidneys and intestines.</p>

<p>The liver also breaks up the worn out
red corpuscles, putting them into condition
to be eliminated in the bile.</p>

<p>It oxidizes and renders harmless poisonous
substances absorbed in the food, such
as fermented food products and alcohol.</p>

<p>The <em>Muscles</em> oxidize the fats and sugars
liberating the latent heat and energy.</p>

<p>They partly oxidize proteins which are
further broken up in the liver.</p>

<p>The <em>Nerves</em> oxidize food materials
stored in the nerve cells, providing nervous
energy.</p>

<p>The <em>Lungs</em> absorb oxygen and throw off
carbon dioxid, watery vapor and some
organic substances.</p>

<p>The <em>Kidneys</em> and The <em>Skin</em> purify the
blood by excreting water, carbon dioxid
and nitrogenous waste.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="FACTORS_INFLUENCING">FACTORS INFLUENCING
DIGESTION</h2>
</div>


<p>As before stated, it is not the food eaten,
but that which the body digests and
assimilates, or appropriates to its needs,
which counts; many factors influence such
nourishment. The principal ones are the
forceful circulation, the breathing of
plenty of oxygen, and the resultant free
elimination of waste.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">The Appetite</div>

<p>If one has no appetite, by far the
safest method is to abstain from
food until the system calls for it, or to eat
but a very little of the lightest food at
regular meal times; be careful not to mince
between meals nor to eat candy nor
pickles. Be sure that the lack of appetite
is not due to mental preoccupation which
does not let the brain relax long enough
for the physical needs to assert themselves.
One should relax the brain in
pleasant thoughts during a meal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>

<p>If the appetite is lacking, because of
physical exhaustion, it is unwise to eat, because
the digestive organs are tired, and to
load a tired stomach with food, still
further weakens it and results in indigestion.
The better plan is to drink two
glasses of cold water and lie down for an
hour; if there is still no desire for food,
drink freely of water, but abstain from
food until hungry.</p>

<p>This should not lead one into forming
the habit of irregular eating, however.
The stomach forms habits and the supply
of food must be regular, just as the
nursing child must be fed regularly, or
digestive disturbance is sure to result.</p>

<p>A wise provision of Nature makes the
system, in a normal condition, its own regulator,
protesting against food when it has
not assimilated or eliminated that consumed.
One should learn to obey such
protests and cut down the quantity when
Nature calls “enough.”</p>

<p>There are exceptions, however. Some
phases of indigestion result in a gnawing
sensation in the stomach, which is often
mistaken for a desire for food. This is
not a normal appetite. Water will usually
relieve it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>

<p>Often loss of appetite is the result of a
clogging of intestines or liver, or to an
excess of bile, which, not having been properly
discharged into the intestines, has
entered the blood stream. An excess of
bile and poisons, indicating a torpid liver,
often expresses itself in a dull mental
force, the toxins deadening the nerve cells.
Nature does not call for more food
until she has eliminated the excess of
waste.</p>

<p>It is commonly stated that the body will
call for what the system requires. This
may have been true of the aborigines, who
ate their food in its natural state, and, to
a certain extent, it is true to-day, but condiments
and stimulants, to make the food
“appetizing,” have unduly stimulated the
nerves and perverted the natural taste;
foods containing their natural amount of
spices or extractives no longer tempt one.
Those whose nerves are highly keyed, form
the habit of seasoning the food too
strongly, making it too stimulating. This
undue stimulant calls for more food at the
time of eating than a normal appetite
would demand. The taste being cultivated
for the stimulant, the habit of eating too
much food is formed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>

<p>There is a difference between the cultivated
and the normal appetite. A child
rarely shows a desire for stimulants or
condiments, unless unwisely encouraged by
an adult, who does it,—<em>not because it is
good for the child, but because the individual
himself has cultivated a taste for it</em>. It
is as easy to form healthful tastes and
habits of eating as unhealthful ones, and
care should especially be exercised in the
formation of healthful habits by the growing
child.</p>

<p>The simple foods, in their natural state,
are in the right condition to be digested,
with the aid of heat to break the cellular
coverings of the globules of some of them,
but time, energy, muscular activity, nerve
force, and money are spent in combining,
seasoning, and cooking foods in such a
manner as often to render them difficult of
digestion.</p>

<p><em>Deep breathing of fresh air, to throw
off the poisonous carbon dioxid and to
supply an abundance of oxygen to oxidize
the waste, thus putting it in condition to
be expelled from the system; brisk exercise
to accelerate the circulation, that the blood
may carry the oxygen freely and that the
tissues may liberate the carbon dioxid and
other waste; and a copious drinking of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
water, are the best tonics for loss of appetite
or for a lack of vitality.</em></p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Economy
in Food</div>

<p>It is economy, therefore, to keep the
digestive organs and the circulation
and tissues strong, in order that all
foods eaten may yield returns, instead of
hampering activity.</p>

<p>The food which furnishes the most
tissue-building substance and yields the
most heat and energy, with the least refuse,
is the economical food. In the
selection of food for any individual, the
result to be gained from the food must
be borne in mind. If one is doing heavy
muscular work, more protein to rebuild
tissue, as well as more carbohydrates and
fats to produce energy, are required than
if one’s habits of work are sedentary. In
mental work, where the brain is continually
active, proteins are required to re-supply
the brain tissue, but the fats and
carbohydrates may be lessened. This
would seem to contradict the theory that
where one’s habits are sedentary and the
brain alone is active, the proteins are not
required. In sedentary occupation, the
carbohydrates and fats are stored within
the system, clogging it and producing
torpid liver, constipation, and obesity,—unless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
the brain is sufficiently active to
use all of the fuel in brain energy.</p>

<p>In a dietary study of the following
tables, the question should be to provide
the largest quantity of nutriment at the
lowest cost, with due attention to palatability
and variety. In the selection of
meats, for instances, while beefsteak may
cost twice as much as beef stew, it must be
borne in mind that beefsteak contains
very little waste, and it contains a large
proportion of albuminoids, or the tissue
building proteins, while, in the beef stew,
the bones and the connective tissue predominate;
the proteins yielded from the
beef stew are a large proportion gelatinoids
and extractives,—not the tissue
building albuminoids. This would not hold
in comparing the cheaper and the more
expensive cuts in the same kind of beefsteak;
the cheaper cuts often yield quite
as much nutriment as the more expensive
ones. Round steak is just as nourishing
as porter-house and much cheaper.</p>

<p>Much is said about the bacteria present
in the atmosphere, the microbes in the
food, etc., that one is puzzled to know,
not only what to eat, but how to breathe,
and, in fact, which way to turn to avoid
them; but microbes and bacteria have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
present in the atmosphere and in matter
everywhere since time began. They are
a part of the natural surroundings, and
the body, if kept in strong vitality, has
sufficient resistive power to enable one to
live unharmed by them. The danger lies
in allowing the system to run down and
the vital force to ebb, so that the body
becomes an easy prey to them.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Habit and
Regularity
of Eating.</div>

<p>There is no doubt but that the
<em>habit</em> of eating governs one’s convictions
of what the system requires.
One is inclined to think
that a desire for a food is a requirement of
Nature; yet it may simply be the continuance
of a habit. The vital organs form
habits just as one forms a habit of walking,
sitting or of carrying the head or the
hands, and habit re-asserts itself.</p>

<p>If a mother feeds her babe every three
hours the child will usually wake and call
for food about this period. If she has
formed the habit of nursing the child every
two hours, it will call for food in about
two hours, even though all symptoms indicate
that the child is over fed.</p>

<p>It is important that both child and adult
establish regular and hygienic habits because
the digestive juices secrete themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
at the regular periods established.
<em>A right habit is as easily formed, and as
difficult to change, as a wrong one.</em></p>

<p>If one forms the habit of eating a certain
amount of food, the stomach calls for
about the same amount, and when one first
begins to change the quantity it protests,
whether the change be to eat more or less.</p>

<p>Few people form the habit of drinking
sufficient water,—particularly if they have
been taught that water at meals is injurious.
In this busy life, few remember
to stop work and drink water between
meals, and if not consumed at the meal
time the system suffers. Many people look
“dried up.”</p>

<p>The habit of drinking two glasses of
water upon first arising, and six more during
the day is an important one.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Frequency
of Meals</div>

<p>There is no doubt but that a large
number of people overload the digestive
organs. This, as well as the
bolting of food, insufficiently masticated,
cannot be too strongly denounced. <em>All
food should be chewed to a pulp before
swallowed.</em></p>

<p>As a relief from overeating, many
theorists are advocating two meals a day,
but the work of the average man is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
planned into morning and afternoon
sessions, and the three meals have been
arranged accordingly.</p>

<p>Where two meals a day are eaten, the
first meal should be at nine or ten o’clock
in the morning and the second meal at
five or six o’clock in the afternoon;
whereas, for the average person who eats
two meals a day, the custom is to go without
food until the midday meal, and then
to eat two meals within six hours, with
nothing more for eighteen hours.</p>

<p>The argument in favor of two meals a
day has been that the digestive system is
inactive during sleep, and, therefore, the
system is not ready for a meal upon
arising, but the latest experiments
(Pawlow) show that digestion continues
during sleep, though less actively. It must
be borne in mind that the average evening
meal is eaten about six o’clock and that
there are about four waking hours between
this meal and the sleep period; also, that
the average individual is awake and
moderately active an hour before the
morning meal. This gives five waking
hours between the evening and the morning
meal. About the same time, five hours,
elapses between the morning and the midday
meal, and between the midday and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
evening meal, so that three meals a day
divide the digestion periods about evenly.</p>

<p>More frequent meals, served in lighter
quantity, with greater regularity, so that
the system is not overloaded at any one
meals, is rational for delicate, or undernourished
nerves and tissues. The little
child is fed regularly every three hours.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Effect of
Exercise and
Breathing upon
Digestion</div>

<p>Daily exercise and the habit of
full breathing are absolutely
necessary that the waste of the
system may be fully liberated,
that the nourishment may be
carried freely to every tissue, and that sufficient
oxygen may be carried through the
blood to oxidize the waste, or, to put it into
condition to be thrown off.</p>

<p>The necessity of oxygen as food is evident.
The body will subsist about forty
days upon the food stored within it, without
re-supply, but it can endure only a
few seconds without oxygen, because heat,
occasioned by the union of oxygen with
carbon and hydrogen, is necessary to keep
up the physical activity termed “life.”
<em>The necessity of habits of full, correct
breathing cannot be too fully emphasized.</em>
The quantity of oxygen, daily consumed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
should fully equal the sum of all other food
elements.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Oxygen is necessary to cause combustion
of fats, starches and sugars, just as it is
necessary to cause combustion of carbon
in wood, or coal.</p>

<p>The heat from “burning” wood is produced
by the oxygen of the air uniting with
hydrogen and carbon, forming carbon-dioxid
(carbonic acid gas) and water.</p>

<p>The light in the burning of wood is
caused by the rapid combustion of the carbonic
acid gas. The same combustion
occurs within the body continuously,
though more slowly, hence no light is produced.</p>

<p>The carbon in the body is liberated and
brought into contact with more oxygen in
the blood through exercise and full breathing,
just as a fire is fanned to flame by
bringing more oxygen into contact with
the fire, by means of a draught of air.
Keep all air away from a fire and it “goes
out,” or ceases to unite with the oxygen,
and no heat is produced; keep all air from
within the body, by cessation of breathing,
and it also becomes cold. A room in which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>the air is impure, containing insufficient
oxygen, is heated with difficulty,—the body
which is not constantly supplied with pure
air generates very little body heat. The
effect of oxygen in the creation of heat is
practically demonstrated by repeatedly
filling the lungs with air while out in the
cold. The body will become quickly warmed
on the coldest day by this practice.</p>

<p>Deep breathing aids digestion and assimilation,
not alone because of the regular
exercise given to the pancreas, the
spleen, the stomach, and the liver by the
correct movement of the diaphragm, but
because of the latent heat which the oxygen
liberates within the digestive organs
and out among the tissues.</p>

<p>While the chemical action of food
creates activity within, this activity is
materially aided by exercise, and oxygen
is imperative, as shown above. Exercise
and oxygen are also necessary for chemical
action in tearing down waste and in putting
raw material into condition to be
appropriated to the body needs.</p>

<p><em>Two glasses of water in the morning and
fifteen minutes’ brisk exercise of well
selected movements, to start a forceful circulation
and to surge the water through
the vital organs, are a daily necessity if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
one is to keep clean and strong within. It
is as important to cleanse the body within
as without. It is the method employed by
all men and women who would retain
strong vital forces to a ripe old age. They
fully enjoy the mere</em> <span class="allsmcap">LIVING</span>.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">“Tired” or
Disturbed
Balance</div>

<p>Since the condition of the body so
materially affects the digestion,
absorption, and metabolism of food,
as well as the elimination of waste,
it is not amiss to discuss it here.</p>

<p>The habit of eating when too tired and
then at once going to work, so that the
blood is called from the stomach, is almost
sure to result in indigestion.</p>

<p>The average person is tired because the
brain and nerves are more active than the
muscles and is rested by muscular exercise,
or change of work.</p>

<p>The regular work of the body in keeping
up the heart action and the circulation
and in renewing and relieving waste, requires
a certain quantity of oxygen to
liberate energy. This energy the system,
in normal condition, with normal breathing,
readily furnishes, but when that used
in undue muscular work is more than that
being liberated at the time, through combustion,
the energy required for the constant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
bodily needs is called upon, and the
muscles, nerves and tissues are then in the
state termed “tired.” They remain so
until sufficient oxygen has liberated more
potential energy than is needed for the
work constantly going on in the body.
When a sufficient supply of oxygen has
been consumed to equal the demand, the
body is in a state of rest.</p>

<p>In mental work the nerves and the brain
call for the surplus energy, while in muscular
work the tissues require it, hence
undue work, either mental or physical, expresses
itself in bodily fatigue, until the
oxygen equals the demand in all parts of
the body.</p>

<p>A torpid condition of body, producing
inertness, means that the waste of the
system is not relieved. It may be that by
reason of insufficient breathing of pure
air, sufficient oxygen is not consumed to
put the waste in condition to be eliminated.
This poisonous carbon dioxid being
hoarded, dulls the nerve sensation and the
brain action and produces more or less of
stupor. It may be because the circulation
in some part of the body is clogged (most
often the portal circulation through the
liver), so that sufficient oxygen is not
carried to that part.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span></p>

<p>Relief from this “inertness” is experienced
most quickly by exercise in the
fresh air, that the circulation may be
quickened and the oxygen more freely
carried to each part. Exercise in one’s
room by the open window, or at least with
the air in the room pure, is often preferable
to outdoor exercise, because the body
can be nude, or so loosely clothed that the
oxygen may not only enter the lungs but
also circulate about the pores of the skin.
Fifteen minutes of brisk exercise in one’s
room is better than a five-mile walk, because
if the exercises be intelligently
selected, every organ and tissue is used,
while walking exercises only about one-fourth
of the muscles. If the circulation
is clogged, the exercising must be kept up
persistently, until the obstruction is removed
and particular attention must be
given to the supply of fresh air in the
room.</p>

<p>After sleeping in a room with impure
air, one arises fatigued, because of insufficient
oxygen to liberate the energy
required for circulation and catabolism,
and because the carbonic acid gas cannot
be relieved without oxygen to cause combustion.
As stated above, if the poisonous
carbonic acid gas remains in the system,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
it deadens the nerve sensation and produces
a semi-stupor.</p>

<p>The relief, then, from the state of body
we call “tired,” is in the distribution of
the circulation, calling the blood from the
unduly distended capillaries, and supplying
the normal quantity of oxygen.
Rightly directed physical exercise renews
the circulation to all parts, incites deep
breathing, and puts the body in the state
of harmony called “rest.”</p>

<p><em>Harmony</em>, either mental or physical, <em>is
rest</em>.</p>

<p>With a little more intelligence in keeping
up the supply and demand of oxygen,
in establishing correct breathing habits,
and in understanding the law of distribution
of circulation, which means the
harmony of forces, this tired world could
draw a deep, restful breath.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Influence of
the Mind</div>

<p>The state of the mind has much to
do in regulating the digestive
system. Cheerful thoughts put the
nerves of the entire organism in a natural
state, while disagreeable thoughts put the
nerves in a tense, unnatural condition. The
nerves to the digestive system are affected
by the tensity of the mind, just as the
nerves to any other part of the body. As<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
an illustration of this;—if one thinks ugly,
disagreeable thoughts for a continuous
period, actual illness results. These
thoughts affect the digestion in such a
manner that the appetite sometimes
entirely wanes. All so-called “new
thoughts,” “ologies,” or “isms,” conducive
to the formation of the habit of
looking upon the bright side of life, or of
looking for good and joy in life, put the
nerves in a natural state, affecting the
digestion and consequently the health.
The practice is Christian <em>Sense</em>.</p>

<p>The nerves control, to a great degree,
the peristaltic movements of the stomach
and the action of the absorption cells, as
well as the cells which secrete the digestive
juices. Thus it is that a food which one
likes is not only more palatable, but it will
digest more readily, because the digestive
juices flow more freely.</p>

<p>It is well, therefore, to begin the meal
with something which tastes particularly
good, that the flow of these digestive juices
may be incited. For this reason, if one
cares for fruit, it is an excellent custom
to begin the meal with fruit, or with soup,
containing protein extractives, which
stimulate the flow of digestive juices. The
habit of finishing a meal with some tasty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
dessert, is based upon the scientific
principle that by so doing the gastric
juices will flow more freely after the meal,
thus aiding in its digestion.</p>

<p>Dainty service in a sick-room, because
of the psychic effect of a meal daintily
served, is of utmost importance. Because
of the effect upon the mind the sight of a
meal served upon soiled linen will almost
stop the flow of gastric juice and destroy
the desire for food, while a meal daintily
served upon dainty linen, with garnishings
and tasteful table decorations, incites the
flow of gastric juices.</p>

<p>The careful wife and mother, who notes
the appetites of members of her family
failing, should attend carefully to the
garnishing of her dishes and to serving
them in a neat, attractive manner; also to
changing her table decorations, as far as
may be consistent, so that the eye as well
as the sense of smell and taste may be
pleased.</p>

<p>It is strange, but it is true, that just a
fresh flower, or a new table decoration,
may so put the mind of one who is afflicted
with nervous indigestion in a receptive
state that the meal more readily digests,
while an untidy table, or a lot of food
served untidily would retard digestion.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
One may be able to control the thoughts
under most circumstances but the above is
a physiological fact.</p>

<p>Sometimes the sight of quantities of
food turns one against it. The custom
among hearty eaters, of serving a plate
too plentifully, destroys the appetite of
one whose digestion is not so hearty.</p>

<p>Our grandmothers’ overloaded tables,
with sufficient food of various kinds to
serve many times the number of participants,
might stimulate the appetite of
hearty, strong men, while the very sight
of so much might turn the appetite of one
more delicate, whose system did not crave
food.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Potatoes.</b> It will be noted from the
above table that sweet potatoes have a
larger percentage of carbohydrates, hence
they produce more heat and energy, than
any other vegetable; next to the sweet
potato, the Irish potato.</p>

<p>In the above table, the skins of the vegetables
are included, and while the white
potato contains two per cent protein, this
is almost all located in a very thin layer
immediately beneath the skin, so that when
the potato is peeled in the ordinary way,
the protein is removed. This holds true
in many vegetables. They lose their distinctive
flavor, as well as their value as
tissue building foods, when the skins are
removed. In baking a potato, the outer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
skin is readily separated from a less perceptible
covering containing the protein,
and this second skin should be eaten to
get the full value and flavor.</p>

<p>In the white potato, of the twenty-two
per cent carbohydrates three and two-tenths
per cent is sugar and eighteen and
eight-tenths per cent is starch. In the
sweet potato, ten and two-tenths per cent
is sugar and sixteen per cent is starch.
Since sugar digests more quickly than
starch, the sweet potato digests more
quickly than the white. Because of the
large per cent or carbohydrates in each,
it is a mistake to serve these two vegetables
at the same meal. For the same
reason, bread and potatoes should not be
eaten, to any extent, at the same meal, unless
by one who is doing heavy manual
labor, requiring much energy.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Onions.</b> Only about four per cent of the
onion represents nourishment; the eleven
per cent of carbohydrates is made up of
two and eight-tenths per cent sugar and
the rest extractives. Of the extractives
the volatile oil, which causes the eyes to
water when peeling, is the most important.
The onion is not, therefore, so important
for its actual nourishing qualities as for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
its relish and flavor, and for this it is to
be commended. It is a diuretic, encouraging
a free action of the kidneys. Because
of its diuretic value it is commonly called
a healthy food. An onion and lettuce
sandwich stimulates the action of the kidneys
and is a nerve sedative.</p>

<p>The volatile oil makes the onion difficult
for some to digest and, in that case, should
be omitted from the diet.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Beets.</b> There is no starch in beets, the
seven and three-tenths per cent carbohydrates
being sugar; they possess, therefore,
more nutritive value than onions, and
they are easily digested. It will be noted
that it takes many beets to make a pound
of sugar.</p>

<p>There are no more delicious nor nutritive
greens than the stem and leaf of the beet.
These greens contain much iron and are
valuable aids in building up the iron in the
blood, thus correcting anaemia.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Carrots.</b> Carrots are valuable as food
chiefly on account of their sugar. They are
somewhat more difficult of digestion than
beets and they contain more waste. They
make a good side dish, boiled and served
with butter or cream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Turnips.</b> Turnips have little value as a
food. Their nutriment consists in the
sugar they contain. For those who enjoy
the flavor they are a relish, serving as an
appetizer, and, like the onion, are to be
recommended as a side dish for this purpose.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Parsnips.</b> Like carrots, parsnips are
chiefly valuable for their sugar and for
the extractives which act as appetizers.</p>

<p>Since turnips, carrots, onions, and parsnips
owe a part of their value in nutrition
to the extractives which whet the appetite
for other foods, it follows that, if one does
not enjoy the flavor or the odor, these vegetables
lose in value to that individual as a
food. If one does enjoy the flavor, it adds
to their food value.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Green
Vegetables</div>

<p>The question may be asked with
reason: “Why do we eat green
vegetables?” They contain only
about four per cent nutrition, as will be
seen by the chemical analysis in the following
table, and are mostly made up of
water and pulp. It will be noted from the
table that they are distinctly lacking in
protein (nitrogenous matter) and in carbohydrates;
hence, they have little food<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
value. Some of them have strong acids,
thus increasing the alkalinity of the blood.</p>

<p>Their merit lies in the fact that they
have distinct flavors and thus whet the appetite.
Another reason why green vegetables
are thoroughly enjoyed is because
they come fresh in the spring, when the
appetite is a little surfeited with the winter
foods and one looks for green things.</p>

<p>All fresh vegetables should be masticated
to almost a fluid consistency; otherwise,
they are difficult of digestion, containing,
as they do, so much pulp.</p>

<p>They are diuretic, helping the kidneys
and the skin to rid the system of waste,
and they are more laxative to the intestines<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
than the root vegetables, partly because
of the salts which they contain and
partly because of the undigested vegetable
fibre, which helps to move along the waste
in the intestines. This vegetable fibre, being
coarse, assists in cleansing the mucous
lining of stomach and intestines, and, if
for no other reason than for this cleansing
of kidneys and intestines in the spring,
when the system is most sluggish, the use
of green vegetables is to be commended.</p>

<p>In larger cities, fresh vegetables are in
the markets the year around, but if they
are raised in greenhouses, or in any way
forced, they lack the matured flavor and
they also lack the iron which the rays of
the sun give. If raised in the south and
shipped for a distance, they are not fresh
and they do not have as good an effect
upon the system as when fresh and fully
matured by the sun.</p>

<p>All greens, as spinach, chard, dandelions
and beet tops, as previously stated,
contain iron and build red blood corpuscles.</p>

<p>It is well, then, to eat freely of fresh
vegetables in their season, even though
they do not appreciably build tissue or
furnish energy. By their effect upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
blood, the kidneys, skin, and intestines,
they make sluggish vital organs more efficient.</p>

<p>Tomatoes and rhubarb are often, and
with reason, classed under fruits.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Fruits</div>

<p>Technically speaking, fruits include
all plant products which bear or contain
a seed. They are valuable for their
acids and organic salts—citrates, malates,
or tartrates of potassium, sodium, magnesium,
and calcium. In the juices of citrous
fruits, are citrates of above minerals.</p>

<p>The fruit juices are readily absorbed
and carried at once to the liver, where the
sodium, magnesium, and potassium are
released and the acids oxidized and
changed to carbonates. They increase the
alkalinity of the blood. These alkalis are
soon eliminated through the kidneys, which
accounts for the diuretic effect of fruits.</p>

<p>The seeds in the small fruits are not
digested, but they serve the purpose of increasing
intestinal peristalsis and of assisting
the movement of the contents of the
intestines. The skin and the fibre of fruits
also assist the intestines in this way, just
as the fibre in vegetables does.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
Fruits may be classified into acid and
sweet fruits. Under <em>acid fruits</em> are the
citrous group—lemons, limes, grape fruit,
oranges, cranberries, gooseberries, whortleberries,
pineapples, currants, and rhubarb—if
rhubarb is to be classed as a fruit.</p>

<p>There has been a commonly accepted
theory that where a blood test shows evidence
of too much uric acid, acid fruits
are to be avoided, but the reverse is true.
It has been fully demonstrated that the
use of acid fruits increases the alkalinity,—or
neutralizes the acids in the blood.</p>

<p>In case of an excess of hydrochloric
acid in the stomach, lemon, or citrous
fruits are valuable about half an hour before
a meal as they decrease the secretion
of the hydrochloric acid into the stomach.
Where hydrochloric acid is limited, acids
are given after a meal to supplement the
deficient amount.</p>

<p>The sweetening of acid fruits does not
detract from the value of the acids or of
organic salts.</p>

<p>All acid fruits stimulate the action of
the kidneys and the skin,—particularly
lemons, limes, grape fruit, and oranges,
and wherever the kidneys and skin are not
sufficiently active, these fruits should be
eaten freely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span></p>

<p>It is difficult to make a decided distinction
between sweet and acid fruits. The
best guide is in the amount of sugar required
to make them palatable. Some
species of cherry are distinctly sour, while
others are sweet. The same is true of
apples, peaches, plums, etc.</p>

<p>Under <em>sweet</em> or <em>bland</em> fruits are pears,
raspberries, grapes, bananas, blackberries,
blueberries, melons, apricots, and some
peaches, apples, and plums.</p>

<p>The large majority of fruits do not
contain sufficient sugar to make them valuable
for nourishment. Their chief value
is in their appetizing flavor, and in the
acids, and salts. Dates, figs, prunes, and
dried grapes (raisins) are exceptions. As
will be noted by the following table, these
fruits contain a large amount of carbohydrates
in the form of sugar. The larger
amount of protein in these sweet fruits
is largely in the seeds and, as the seeds are
not digested, they have no real food value
to the individual.</p>

<p>Figs and prunes are laxative,—probably
the laxative effect of figs is due to the
seeds, and of prunes to the salts and acids.
However, prunes are free from tannic
acid.</p>

<p>Care should be exercised in selecting
ripe fruits and those which have not
started to decay. The difficulty with so
many fruits, which must be shipped from
a distance, is, that, in order to reach their
destination in fair condition, outwardly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
they are picked before ripe and there is
too much tannic acid in them. When fruits
are allowed to ripen on the trees, the tannic
acid is changed to sugar and fruit juices.
One test of a ripened apple is to cut it with
a steel knife—if the blade turns black, or
if the cut surface of the apple turns brown
in a few minutes, it should not be eaten,
for it indicates an excess of tannin. It is
this tannin which gives the small boy, with
his green apples, excruciating pains. It
will be recalled that the tannin from the
bark of trees, so toughens the elastic skin
of animals that we can wear this skin for
shoes. The effect upon the live skin of
the stomach and intestines, from the tannin
in food, is not pronounced in toughening
the skin, because of the activity and resistance
of live matter.</p>

<p>Bananas are commonly picked green, because
they decay so quickly that if they
were picked ripe they would spoil before
reaching the northern markets. The above
table shows that bananas contain nearly
twenty-three per cent of carbohydrates,
which, in an immature state, are largely
starches. The natural ripening process
changes the starch to sugar, thus making
them more easily digested. The starch
globules, when not matured on the tree,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
are not easily broken and are thus difficult
of digestion. Baking breaks the globules;
a baked banana is thus more readily digested.</p>


<h2>Nitrogenous Foods</h2>

<p>As previously stated, in a mixed diet
meat and eggs are the chief sources of
nitrogenous foods. Next to these come the
legumes.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Meat</div>

<p>Meat is almost all digested in the
stomach by the gastric juice, which
changes it into peptone. It is needless to
say that it should be thoroughly masticated
that there may be no delay in the
prompt action of the gastric juice upon it.
If any part passes into the intestine undigested,
the process is continued by the
trypsin of the pancreatic juice. The peptone
is absorbed as peptone and after it
passes through the inner coating of the
intestines, it is changed back to protein
and carried by the blood and lymph to all
tissues of the body, where it is used for
growth and repairs. As stated, any excess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
of protein above that needed for growth
and repair, is oxidized in the blood,
yielding energy and heat, and the waste is
eliminated through the kidneys and the
bile. The red blood corpuscles, which are
nitrogenous, are broken down in the liver
and discharged through the bile.</p>

<p>In the composition of meat, of course
there is more or less fat, varying from two
to forty per cent, according to the animal
and to the condition at the time of killing.</p>

<p>It is possible to combine the fat and the
lean of meat so as to meet the requirements
of the body without waste. About ninety-seven
per cent of the meat consumed is
assimilated by the system, while a large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
part of the vegetable matter consumed is
excreted as refuse. The compounds contained
in the animal foods are much like
those of the body, therefore, they require
comparatively little digestion to prepare
them for assimilation—this work having
been done by the animal—while the vegetable
compounds require much change by
the digestive system before they can be
used in the body.</p>

<p>Fish and sea foods are, many of them,
rich in protein, as seen by the above table.
Note that sardines contain the largest proportion
of protein and next to these, shad
roe.</p>

<p>There is a prevalent idea that fish is
brain food. In so far as fish is easily digested,
it builds brain tissue, but no more
so than beef, or any food containing a
goodly proportion of protein, easily digested,
absorbed, and assimilated.</p>

<p>Lobsters are difficult of digestion and
they contain little nutrition, so they are
not valuable as a food.</p>

<p>Oysters, raw, are easier to digest than
when cooked. Oysters should not be eaten
during the spawning season from May to
September.</p>

<p>Roasted flesh seems to be more completely
digested than boiled meat, but raw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
meat is more easily digested than cooked.
Roasted chicken and veal are tender, easily
masticated, and easily and rapidly digested
in the stomach. This is one reason why
the white meats are considered a good diet
for the sick-room, especially in the case of
stomach difficulty. Fat meats remain in the
stomach a much longer time than lean
meats; thus, gastric digestion of pork,
which is largely fat, is especially difficult.
Fried pork, in which the fat is heated to a
very high degree, is very difficult of digestion.
(See page <a href="#Page_197">197</a>).</p>

<p>The chief objection to pork, however, is
that hogs are scavengers and live upon all
sorts of refuse. Another objection is that
in preparing hogs for the market, the effort
of the farmer is to force the feeding
and get them as fat as possible. This excess
of fat may result in degeneration of
the meat tissue. The latter objection does
not hold, however, for hogs carefully
fatted for home consumption, or for hogs
which run in the forests and live upon
nuts, as do the beech fed hogs of the south.</p>

<p>The best meats are from young animals
which have been kept fat and have not been
subjected to any work to toughen the
muscles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span></p>

<p>Preserved and canned meats should be
eaten with the utmost caution, not only
because of the inferior meat used in the
preparation of these foods, but also from
the fact that they may become putrid after
being canned.</p>

<p>The proportion of <em>albuminoids</em>, <em>gelatinoids</em>
and <em>extractives</em> in meat vary with different
meats and with different cuts of the
same meat.</p>

<p>The <em>albuminoids</em> of meat include the
meat tissue, or the muscle cells. These
constitute by far the greater part of the
meat.</p>

<p>The <em>gelatinoids</em> are the connective tissue
forming the sheath of the muscle and of
bundles of muscles, the skin, tendons, and
the casein of bone. Gelatines are made
from these and, if pure and prepared in
a cleanly manner, they are wholesome.</p>

<p>Gelatin is distinguishable in rich meat
soups, which jelly upon cooling.</p>

<p>While the gelatinoids are not muscle,
they keep the muscles from being consumed
when starches, sugars, and fats are
lacking, and, in this sense, may be considered
more in the nature of carbohydrates.</p>

<p>The <em>extractives</em> consist of a substance
within the lean meat, known as creatin.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
This creatin is not a food; it is an appetizer,
and gives to cooked meats, broths, etc.,
their pleasing flavor. In case of anaemia
where it is necessary to build up red blood
corpuscles, it is desirable to have the
patient take the blood of beef, the thought
of which is usually repellant, but it may
be made very palatable if it is heated sufficiently
to bring out the extractives, or
flavor, and then seasoned.</p>

<p>Unless the beef extracts on the market
contain the blood tissue in addition to the
extractives, they are not particularly nourishing
and are only valuable in soups, etc.,
as appetizers.</p>

<p>One reason why meat soups constitute
the first course at dinner is because the
extractives stimulate the appetite and
start the flow of gastric juices. Bouillons
contain no nourishment, because the proteins
have been coagulated by the vigorous
boiling, but they may be used as a basis
for vegetables, rice, or barley to give them
flavor.</p>

<p>The best method is to make one’s own
soup from the connective tissues (gelatinoids)
and meat tissue.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Eggs</div>

<p>Eggs consist chiefly of two nutrients,—protein,
and fat (ten per cent), combined
with water, phosphorous, and ash.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
Eggs are a wholesome source of protein
and are, therefore, classed as nitrogenous
foods.</p>

<p>The fat and the iron are in the yolk,
which is about one-third fat. The yolk also
contains phosphorous and some ash. The
white is practically free from fat but contains
sulphur, phosphorous and a very
little ash. The white and the yolk contain
almost equal quantities of protein.</p>

<p>The white of the egg is said to be pure
albumen; the chief ash constituent is common
salt. The total phosphorous in the
white of the egg is equivalent to about two
per cent phosphoric acid and the total phosphorous
in the yolk is equivalent to one
per cent.</p>

<p>The dark stain made by eggs on silver
is due to the sulphur contained in them.
The iron in the egg is valuable to assist in
building red corpuscles.</p>

<p>The large part of the egg, as other proteins,
is changed, mostly in the stomach,
into peptone, absorbed as peptone and then
changed back again into protein after absorption.
That not digested in the stomach
is changed in the intestine, as is the
case with other proteins.</p>

<p>Eggs are, no doubt, excellent articles of
food for nutrition and for tissue building.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
They contain more water than cheese, but
are more concentrated than milk or oysters.
They have practically the same relative
value in the diet as meat, and make a
very good substitute for meat. Egg yolk
in abundance is often prescribed where it
is necessary to supply a very nutritious
and easily assimilated diet.</p>

<p>One of the best methods of preparing
eggs, which is especially valuable for those
having delicate stomachs or for those
who need to build up red blood corpuscles
with the iron in the yolk, is in egg
lemonade or orangeade. Thoroughly beat
the egg, add the juice of half a lemon or
orange, sugar to taste, and fill the glass
with water.</p>

<p>The citric acid in these fruits partly digests
the egg, changing it into egg albumin,—the
egg becomes limpid, no longer
stringy. From this condition the gastric
juice quickly changes it to peptone.</p>

<p>Grape juice, cream, and cocoa may be
used in place of lemon or orange, in order
to give variety where it is necessary to
take many of them, but the grape juice acid
does not partially digest the egg as the
juice of the lemon does.</p>

<p>Eggnog is another means of taking raw
eggs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span></p>

<p>One method which any housewife can
use to test the freshness of eggs is to drop
them into a strong, salt brine made of two
ounces of salt to a pint of water. A fresh
egg will at once sink to the bottom. After
the third day the surface of the shell will
be even with the surface of the water and
with increasing age they will rise still
higher.</p>

<p>There is a prevalent opinion that if an
egg is boiled hard it is difficult of digestion,
but this depends entirely upon the mastication.
If it is masticated so that it is a pulp
before swallowed, a hard boiled egg is
digested as readily as a soft boiled one.
If it is not thoroughly masticated, then an
egg should not be boiled longer than three
to four minutes, or should be put into boiling
water and allowed to remain in the
water for six minutes without actively boiling.
The latter method cooks the egg
through more evenly. Another method of
cooking the yolk evenly with the whites is
to put the egg in cold water, let it come
to a boil, and then again immerse in cold
water. Or the egg may be put in cold
water, let come almost to a boil, removed
from the stove, and let stand ten to twelve
minutes in the hot water. Any one of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
last three methods cooks the white and
the yolk evenly.</p>


<h2>Carbo-Nitrogenous Foods</h2>

<p>Under this class come cereals, legumes,
nuts, milk, and milk products. In these
foods the nitrogenous and carbonaceous
elements are more evenly proportioned
than in either the carbonaceous or nitrogenous
groups. The different food elements
in this group are so evenly divided
that one could live for a considerable length
of time upon any one food. Some animals
build flesh from nuts alone, while the herbivorous
animals live upon cereals and
plants.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Cereals</div>

<p>Under cereals, used by man for food,
come wheat, oats, rye, barley, rice,
and corn. As will be noted by the table
below, cereals contain a large proportion
of starch and are therefore to be used
largely for heat and energy. Rice contains
the largest proportion and next to rice,
wheat flour.</p>

<p>There is no part of the world, except the
Arctic regions, where cereals are not extensively
cultivated. From the oats and
rye of the north, to the rice of the hot countries,
grains of some kind are staple foods.</p>

<p>“An idea of the importance of cereal
foods in the diet may be gathered from the
following data, based upon the results obtained
in dietary studies with a large number
of American families:—Vegetable
foods, including flour, bread, and other
cereal products, furnished fifty-five per
cent of the total food, thirty-nine per cent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
of the protein, eight per cent of the fat,
and ninety-five per cent of the carbohydrates
of the diet. The amounts which
cereal foods alone supplied were twenty-two
per cent of the total food, thirty-one
per cent of the protein, seven per cent of
the fat and fifty-five per cent of the total
carbohydrates—that is, about three-quarters
of the vegetable protein, one-half of
the carbohydrates, and seven-eighths of the
vegetable fat were supplied by the cereals.
Oat, rice, and wheat breakfast foods together
furnished about two per cent of the
total food in protein, one per cent of the
total fat, and four per cent of the carbohydrates
of the ordinary mixed diet, as
shown by the statistics cited. These percentage
values are not high in themselves,
but it must be remembered that they represent
large quantities when we consider the
food consumed by a family in a year.”<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>If one’s work calls for extreme muscular
exertion, the cereals may be eaten freely,
but if one’s habits are sedentary, and
the cereals are used in excess, there is
danger of clogging the system with too
much glycogen, or converted starch. Indeed,
for one whose occupation is indoors
and requires little muscular activity,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>a very little cereal food will suffice; the
carbohydrates will be supplied, in sufficient
quantity, in vegetables. Mineral
matter is supplied in sufficient quantity in
almost all classes of foods.</p>

<p>The power of the system to throw off
food, over and above the needs of the body,
is a wise provision of Nature, because
where foods are not supplied in the proper
proportions, a more liberal diet enables
the system to select such foods as it needs
from the abundance.</p>

<p>Cereals and legumes supply nutrients
cheaper than any class of foods; therefore
a vegetarian diet involves less expense
than the mixed diet. Meat, eggs and milk,
which usually supply the proteins, are the
most expensive foods, and where these are
eliminated, a large proportion of proteins
should be supplied by the legumes.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Wheat.</b> Perhaps no food is as commonly
used as wheat, in its various forms.
It is composed of:</p>

<p>First—The nitrogenous or protein compound,
chiefly represented in the cerealin
and the gluten of the bran.</p>

<p>Second—The carbon extracts,—the largest
contributor to the flour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span></p>

<p>Third—The fats, occurring chiefly in the
germ of the grain.</p>

<p>Fourth—The phosphorous compounds,
iron and lime, found in the bran.</p>

<p>The kernel of wheat consists of the bran
or covering, which surrounds the white,
pulpy mass of starch within. In the lower
end of the kernel is the germ.</p>

<p><em>Flour.</em> In the old time process of making
flour the wheat was crushed between
stones and then sifted, first, through a
sieve, which separated the outer shell of
the bran; then through bolting cloth,
which separated the white pulp from the
inner bran coating. It was not ground as
fine as in the present process, thus the gluten,
phosphorous, and iron (valuable
foods) were, in the old process, nearly all
left out of the white flour. The second
bran coating, left by the second sifting,
was not so coarse as the outer shell but
coarser than the inner. Care was not formerly
observed in having the grain clean
before grinding, the bran containing chaff
and dirt, so that it was not used as food
but was considered valuable for stock and
was called “middlings.”</p>

<p>The modern process of crushing the
wheat between steel rollers, crushes it so
fine that the white flour of to-day contains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
more of the protein from the inner coat of
the bran than the white flour of the old
process; hence, it is more nutritious.</p>

<p><em>Bran.</em> Objection is sometimes made to
bran because the cellulose shell is not digested,
but bran contains much protein
and mineral matter and, even though it is
crude fiber, as stated above, this fiber has
a value as a cleanser for the lining of stomach
and intestines, and for increasing peristalsis,
thus encouraging the flow of digestive
juices and the elimination of waste.
In bread or breakfast foods, it is desirable
to retain it for its laxative effect.</p>

<p>The bran has three coats,—the tough,
glossy outside, within this a coat containing
most of the coloring matter, and a third
coat, containing a special kind of protein,
known as cerealin. The two outer layers
contain phosphorous compounds, lime, and
iron. All three coats contain gluten.</p>

<p>Of course there is more waste in bread
made with bran and in consequence, there
is a smaller <em>proportion</em> of the nutrition in
graham bread. It is held by some, however,
that more of the nutrition is digested
than in white bread.</p>

<p><em>Gluten flour</em> is made of the gluten of
wheat. It is a valuable, easily digested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
food, containing a large proportion of protein.</p>

<p><em>Whole wheat</em> flour does not contain the
whole of the wheat, as the name implies;
it, however, does contain all the proteins
of the endosperm and the gluten and oil
of the germ, together with all of the starch.
As a flour, therefore, it is more valuable
than the white flour, containing more
nitrogenous elements.</p>

<p><em>Graham flour</em> is the entire wheat kernel;
with the exception of the outermost
scale of the bran. It contains the starch,
gluten, phosphorous compounds, iron and
lime. It is the most desirable of the flours
because, containing the bran, it assists in
digestion and elimination, and the phosphorous,
iron and lime are valuable for
body building.</p>

<p><em>Nutri meal</em> is much the same as Graham
flour, the chief difference being that the
bran is ground finer. The wheat is ground
between hot rollers, the heat bringing out
the nutty flavor of the bran. It contains
all of the nutrition of the wheat.</p>

<p><em>Bread.</em> As must be implied from the
above, the “whole wheat,” nutri meal, or
graham flours are necessary if bread is to
be a complete food.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span></p>

<p>There is perhaps no form of prepared
food which has been longer in vogue. It
has been known since history began. It
probably maintains and supports life and
strength better than any single food. The
ease with which it is digested depends very
largely upon its porous condition. When
full of pores, it is more readily mixed with
the digestive juices.</p>

<p>The pores in bread are produced by the
effort of the gas, released by the yeast, to
escape. When mixed with water, the flour
forms a tenacious body which, when warm,
expands under the pressure of the gas
from the yeast, until the dough is full of
gas-filled holes. The walls of the gluten
do not allow the gas to escape, and thus the
dough is made light and porous. The more
gluten the flour holds, the more water it
will take up in the dough, and the greater
will be the yield of bread; hence, the more
gluten, the more valuable the flour. If the
bread is not porous, the fermentation is
not complete, and the bread is heavy.</p>

<p>Yeast is a plant fungus. In its feeding,
the plant consumes sugar, changing it into
alcohol and carbonic acid gas. If the bread
contains no sugar the yeast plant will
change the starch in the flour into sugar
for its feeding. Many housewives, realizing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
that the bread begins to “rise” quicker
if it contains sugar, put a little into the
sponge. Unless a large quantity of sugar
is put in, the yeast will consume it and the
bread will not have an unduly sweet taste.</p>

<p>As the yeast causes fermentation, alcohol
forms in the dough. This is driven off
in the baking. If the bread is not thoroughly
done, the alcohol continues to ferment
and the bread turns sour. Bread is
not thoroughly baked until fermentation
ceases. It is claimed that fermentation
does not entirely cease with once baking;
this is the basis of the theory, held by
some, that bread should be twice baked.
The average housekeeper bakes an ordinary
loaf one hour.</p>

<p>Time must be given for the products of
fermentation to evaporate, in the cooling
of the bread, before it is eaten and it is not
ready to eat for eight to ten hours after
baking. Hot or insufficiently cooked bread
is difficult of digestion, because it becomes
more or less soggy upon entering the mouth
and the stomach, and the saliva and gastric
juices cannot so readily mix with it.</p>

<p>The best flour for bread is that made
from the spring wheat, grown in cooler climates,
because it is richer in gluten than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
the winter wheat. The winter wheat flour
is used more for cakes and pastries.</p>

<p>Bread made from milk, is, of course,
richer and more nutritious than that made
from water and bread made from potato
water contains more starch; both of these
retain their moisture longer than bread
made with water.</p>

<p>Mould, which sometimes forms upon
bread, is, like the yeast, a minute plant. It
is floating about everywhere in the air,
ready to settle down wherever it finds a
suitable home. Moisture and heat favor
its growth, hence bread should be thoroughly
cooled before it is put into a jar or
bread box and the bread box should be kept
in a cool place.</p>

<p><em>Rye bread</em> contains a little more starch
and less protein than wheat bread. It contains
more water and holds its moisture
longer.</p>

<p><em>Biscuits.</em> The objection to eating hot
bread, does not hold for baking powder or
soda biscuits, if well cooked, because these
cool more rapidly and they do not contain
the yeast plant; hence, they do not ferment
as does the bread.</p>

<p>Baking powder is made from bicarbonate
of soda (baking soda) and cream of
tartar. When these are brought in contact<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
with moisture, carbon dioxid is formed,
and, in the effort to escape, it causes the
dough to expand and become light. The
reason that the cook attempts to bake her
biscuits, or anything made with baking
powder as quickly as possible, after the
baking powder comes in contact with the
moisture, is that the dough may have the
full effect of the expansion of the gas. If
the room in which she mixes her dough
is cool, or if her biscuit dough is left in a
cool place, this is not important, as heat
and moisture are both required for full
combustion.</p>

<p><em>Macaroni and spaghetti</em> are made from
a special wheat flour rich in gluten known
as Durum. They contain about seventy-seven
per cent starch, little fat and little
protein. They may take the place of
bread, rice or potato at a meal.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Rice</b> is a staple cereal in all tropical and
temperate climates. It requires special
machinery to remove the husk and the
dark, outer skin of the kernel. It is seldom
eaten within three months after harvesting
and it is considered even better after two
or three years. It requires thorough cooking.</p>

<p>Unhusked rice is called paddy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span></p>

<p><em>Wild rice</em> is used by the North American
Indians. The seeds are longer, thinner
and darker, than the tame rice. It is
coming into favor as a side dish, but it is
served more particularly at hotels in soup
and with game.</p>

<p>As previously stated, rice contains a
larger proportion of starch than any other
cereal and the smallest proportion of protein.
Next to rice, in starches, comes wheat
flour; yet whole wheat or graham flour
contain half as much again of protein.</p>

<p>Because of the quantity of starch in
flour, potatoes and rice, it is obvious that
one should not eat freely of more than one
of these at the same meal, else the digestive
organs will be overworked in converting
the starch into sugar and the liver overworked
in converting the sugar into glycogen
and back again into sugar; and the
liver will be overloaded in storing it up.
By far the best plan is to eat but one cereal
at a meal.</p>

<p>Rice contains no gluten, hence it cannot
be raised in bread.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Corn</b> (maize) is a native of America
and has been one of the most extensively
used cereals. Corn bread and corn meal
mush were important foods with the early<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
settlers, partly because they are nutritious
and partly because the corn meal was easily
prepared at the mill and was cheap.
The germ of the corn is larger in proportion
than the germs of other grains, and it
contains much fat; therefore it is heating.
For this reason, it is strange that corn
bread is so largely used by inhabitants of
the southern states. It is a more appropriate
food for winter in cold climates.</p>

<p>Because of the fat in the germ, cornmeal
readily turns rancid, and, on this account,
the germ is separated and omitted from
many cornmeal preparations.</p>

<p><em>Hulled corn</em>, sometimes called lye hominy,
is one of the old-fashioned ways of
using corn. In its preparation, the skin
is loosened by steeping the corn in a weak
solution of lye, which gives it a peculiar
flavor, pleasing to many.</p>

<p><em>Cornmeal mush</em> is a valuable breakfast
food.</p>

<p><em>Pop corn.</em> The bursting of the shell in
popping corn is due to the expansion of the
moisture in the starch, occasioned by the
heat.</p>

<p><em>Green sweet corn</em> does not contain the
same proportion of starch as cornmeal, it
being, in its tender state, mostly water.
It is laxative, because it is eaten with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
coarse hull, which causes more rapid peristalsis
of the intestines.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Breakfast
Foods</div>

<p>The claims made for various advertised
breakfast foods would be
amusing if they were not intended
to mislead. Nearly all of them have sufficient
merit to sell them, if the advertiser
confines himself strictly to the truth, but
the ever pertinent desire to excel, which is
one great incentive to progress, leads to exaggeration.
For example: Claim is sometimes
made that they contain more nutriment
than the same quantity of beef. Reference
to above table does not bear out
such statement; they contain more starch
but less protein. It is also claimed by some
advertisers that breakfast foods are brain
and nerve foods. The idea that certain
foods are brain and nerve foods is erroneous,
excepting that any tissue building
food (protein) builds nerve and brain tissue
as it builds any other tissue. There
is a prevalent idea that fish and celery are
brain food, but there is no scientific basis
for the theory.</p>

<p>The grains commonly used for breakfast
foods are corn, oats, rice, and wheat. Barley,
and wild rice, millet and buckwheat
are used in some sections but not enough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
to warrant discussion here. Barley is
used chiefly for making malt and pearled
barley for soups.</p>

<p>The following table, from one of the bulletins
published by the United States Department
of Agriculture, is interesting
from an economical standpoint.</p>

<p>The less expensive breakfast foods, such
as oatmeal and cornmeal, are as economical
as flour, and, as they supply heat and
energy in abundance, as shown by above
table, they should be supplied in the diet in
proportion to the energy required. They
are easily prepared for porridge, requiring
simply to be boiled in water, with a
little salt.</p>

<p>For invalids, children and old people,
breakfast foods prepared in gruels and
porridges are valuable as they are easily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
digested. All should be thoroughly cooked
so as to break the cells enclosing the starch
granules.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Predigested Foods.</b> Some foods are
claimed to be partly digested and thus
valuable for those with weak stomachs,
but breakfast foods are largely starch and
the gastric juices are not active in the
digestion of starch. It is digested by saliva
and the ferment diastase in the intestines.
(Diastase is a ferment of saliva and
pancreatic juice, which changes starch
into dextrin and maltose, in which form it
is more easily acted upon by the intestinal
juices.)</p>

<p>Experiments with “predigested” foods
do not show a larger proportion of dextrin,
however, than would naturally be produced
by the heating of the starch, as these foods
are being cooked at home. The natural
cooking at home makes starch more or less
soluble, or at least gelatinized. As a result
of these experiments, therefore the “predigested”
argument is not given much
weight.</p>

<p>Predigested foods, excepting in cases so
weak as to be under the direction of a
physician, are not desirable. Nature requires
every organ to do the work intended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
for it, in order to keep up its strength,
just as she requires exercise for the arms
or legs to keep them strong. If an organ
is weak, the <em>cause</em> must be found and corrected,—perhaps
the stomach or intestines
need more blood which should be supplied
through exercise; or perhaps the nerves
need relaxation; or the stomach less food;
or food at more regular intervals.</p>

<p>Another argument against predigested
foods lies in the fact that dentists hold that
the chewing of coarse food is necessary to
keep the teeth strong. For this strengthening
of the teeth, children are given dry
crackers and dry toast each day.</p>

<p>In the so-called “predigested” or
“malted” preparations, malt is added
while they are being cooked. Malt is a ferment
made from some grain, usually from
barley, the grain being allowed to germinate
until the ferment diastase is developed.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that a number of
foods, containing malt are valuable in the
hands of physicians to assist in converting
starch into dextrin or sugar, where diastase
is not formed in sufficient quantity,
just as pepsin is an aid in the digestion of
protein,—but eaten indiscriminately, there
can be no question that it is more important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
for the stomach and intestines to perform
their natural work and thus keep
their strength through normal exercise.</p>

<p>While they are not “predigested,” as
claimed, they are, as a rule, wholesome and
nutritious. They are cleanly, and made
from good, sound grain and they contain
no harmful ingredients. Some contain
“middlings,” molasses, glucose and similar
materials, but these are in no way injurious
and have value as foods. The dry,
crisp, ready-to-eat foods are especially
advantageous because of the mastication
they require,—this mastication insuring
plenty of saliva being mixed with
them to aid in digestion. A dish of such
dry breakfast food, well masticated, together
with an egg, to furnish a larger proportion
of protein, makes a wholesome
breakfast.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Cracked Wheat.</b> In America wheat is
seldom used whole. In England the whole
grain, with the bran left on, is slightly
crushed and served as cracked wheat or
wheat grits.</p>

<p>Wheat is also rolled, or flaked, or
shredded. The majority of wheat breakfast
foods contain a part of the middlings
and many of them bran. Farina and gluten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
preparations do not contain these,
however.</p>

<p>The preparations of the various breakfast
foods are a secret of the proprietors.
The ready-to-eat brands are cooked, then
they are either rolled or shredded, the
shredding requiring special machinery to
tear the steamed kernels; later they are
dried, and, finally packed, sometimes in
small biscuits. Many preparations are
baked after being steamed, which turns
them darker and makes them more crisp.
Some preparations are steamed, then run
through rollers, while still wet, and pressed
into flakes or crackers.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Oatmeals</b> are the most nutritious cereals.
The oat contains more fat than other
grains and a larger proportion of protein.
It is, therefore, the best adapted to sustain
life in the proportion of nutrient elements.
On account of the fat, oats are especially
well adapted for a breakfast food in winter.
Another advantage oatmeal, or rolled
oats, have as a breakfast food is in their
laxative tendency, due to the coarse shell
of the kernel.</p>

<p>Oat breakfast foods keep longer than the
foods made from wheat and rice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span></p>

<p>There are no malts, or any mixtures in
the oat preparations. The difference between
the various oatmeal breakfast foods
is in their manner of preparation. They
all contain the entire grain, with the exception
of the husk. They are simply the
ground or crushed oat. In preparing the
oats before grinding, the outer hull is removed,
the fuzzy coating of the berry itself
is scoured off, the ends of the berry, particularly
the end containing the germ,
which is usually the place of deposit for
insect eggs, is scoured, and the bitter tip
end of the oat berry is likewise removed.</p>

<p><em>Rolled oats</em> consist of the whole berry
of the oat, ground into a coarse meal, either
between millstones, or, in the case of the
so called “steel cut” oatmeal, cut with
sharp steel knives across the sections of
the whole oat groat.</p>

<p><em>Quaker Oats</em> consist of the whole groat,
which, after steaming in order to soften,
have been passed between hot steel rolls,
somewhat like a mangle in a laundry,
and crushed into large, thin, partially
cooked flakes. The oats are then further
cooked by an open pan drying process.
This roasting process insures that all germ
life is exterminated, renders the product
capable of quicker preparation for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
table and the roasting causes the oil cells
to release their contents, thereby producing
what is termed the “nut flavor,” which
is not present in the old fashioned type of
oat product.</p>

<p>Both Rolled Oats and Quaker Oats are
now partially cooked in their preparation
but the starch cells must be thoroughly
broken and they should be cooked at least
forty-five minutes in a double boiler; or, a
good way to prepare the porridge, is to
bring it to the boiling point at night, let
it stand covered over night and then cook
it twenty to thirty minutes in the morning.
Another method of cooking is to bring the
porridge to the boiling point and then leave
it in a fireless cooker over night.</p>

<p>The great fault in the preparation of
any breakfast food is in not cooking it sufficiently
to break the starch cells.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Puffed Rice</b> is made from a good quality
of finished rice. The process is a peculiar
one, the outer covering, or bran, is removed
and then the product is literally “shot
from guns;” that is, a quantity of the rice
is placed in metal retorts, revolved slowly
in an oven, at high temperature, until the
pressure of steam, as shown by gauge on
the gun, indicates that the steam, generated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
slowly by the moisture within the
grain itself, has thoroughly softened the
starch cells. The gun retort is pointed into
a wire cage and the cap which closes one
end is removed, permitting an inrush of
cold air. This cold, on striking the hot
steam, causes expansion, which amounts
practically to an explosion. The expansion
of steam within each starch cell completely
shatters the cell, causing the grain
to expand to eight times its original size.
It rushes out of the gun and into the cage
with great force, after which it is screened
to remove all scorched or imperfectly
puffed grains.</p>

<p>This process dextrinizes a portion of the
starch and also very materially increases
the amount of soluble material as against
the original proportion in the grain.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Puffed Wheat</b> is manufactured from
Durum, or macaroni wheat, of the very
highest grade. This is a very hard, glutinous
grain. It is pearled in order to
thoroughly clean and take off the outer
covering of bran. It then goes through a
puffing process, identical with that of
Puffed Rice. The chemical changes are
very similar to those of puffed rice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span></p>

<p>Both Puffed Rice and Puffed Wheat are
more digestible than in the original grain
state. They are valuable foods for invalids.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Stale Bread.</b> A food which tastes much
like a prepared breakfast food, but is
cheaper, may be made by dipping stale
bread into molasses and water, drying it
in the oven for several hours, and then
crushing it. It is then ready to serve with
cream. This is a palatable way to use up
stale bread.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Crackers and Milk or Bread and Milk.</b> As
noted by above table, crackers are similar
to breakfast foods in nutrient elements,
and with milk make a good food for breakfast,
or a good luncheon. Business men,
and others who eat hurriedly and return
immediately to work, will do well to substitute
crackers and milk, or bread and milk,
for the piece of pie, which often constitutes
a busy man’s lunch.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Cereal
Coffees</div>

<p>According to investigations made
by the United States Agriculture
Experiment Station, cereal coffees
are made of parched grains. A few contain
a little true coffee, but for the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
part they are made of parched wheat, barley,
etc., or of grain mixed with wheat middlings,
pea hulls, or corn cobs. There is
no objection to any of these mixtures providing
they are clean. The cereal coffees,
as seen by the following table, contain no
more nourishment than the true coffee, but
they are probably more easily digested;
only a very little of the soluble starch
passes into the water. Coffee and tea are
not taken for their nutrition, but for their
stimulating effect upon the nerves; and, if
stimulation is desired, the cereal coffees
fall short.</p>

</table>


<p>By reference to table VII it will be seen
that cocoa and skimmed milk contain much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
more nutrition than any of the coffees.
Their chief value is that they furnish a
<em>warm</em> drink with the meal. They should
not be too hot.</p>

<p>Barley or wheat, mixed with a little
molasses, parched in the oven, and then
ground, makes about the same mixture as
the cereal coffee.</p>

<p>The old fashioned crust coffee, made
from bread crusts, toasted in the oven, is
just as nutritious as any of the coffees and
has the advantage of being cheaper.</p>

<p>Barley water and oat water, made by
boiling the grain thoroughly and then
straining, are nourishing foods for invalids
and children. They are often used
as drinks by athletes and manual laborers,
as they have the advantage of both quenching
thirst and supplying energy.</p>

<p>Gruels are made in the same way, only
strained through a sieve. This process
allows more of the starch to pass with the
water.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Legumes</div>

<p>The legumes are the seeds of peas,
beans, lentils and peanuts.</p>

<p>While they are seeds, just as the cereals
are, they differ in that they contain a
very much larger proportion of protein
and may be substituted for meat or eggs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
in a diet. In all vegetarian diets the
legumes should be used freely to replace
the meat.</p>

<p>All legumes must be thoroughly cooked
and thoroughly masticated. Because the
protein in these foods is more difficult of
digestion than that in meat or eggs, particularly
if not thoroughly masticated, they
are better adapted for the use of men doing
manual labor. Soldiers, day laborers,
and others, whose work calls for physical
exercise, can digest legumes, when those
whose occupation is more sedentary can
not do so.</p>

<p>The protein of the legumes is of the same
nature as the casein of milk. It has been
called vegetable casein.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Peanuts.</b> While an underground vegetable,
grown like potatoes, peanuts resemble
nuts, inasmuch as they contain so
much oil. Like other legumes, they require
cooking. They are roasted because this
develops the flavor.</p>

<p>Because of the proportion of the chemical
elements in peanuts, they will sustain
life for an indefinite period, without other
food, as they provide rebuilding material,
energy and heat. Used alone, however,
there is no counteracting acid, and it is
better to add some fruit, such as apples, or
apples and dates.</p>

<p>In eating peanuts it is imperative that
they be masticated <em>until they are a pulp</em>;
otherwise they are very difficult of digestion.
The pain which many people experience,
after eating peanuts, is probably due
to eating too large a quantity and not fully
masticating them, forgetting that they are
a very rich, highly-concentrated food. Both
peanuts and peanut butter contain over
twenty-five per cent of protein and a much
larger percentage of fat; therefore they
yield much heat and energy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span></p>

<p><em>Peanut Butter.</em> While peanut butter
contains forty-six and one half per cent
fat, it contains only seventeen per cent
carbohydrates. Since sugars and starches
are protections to fat, being used for energy
before the fats are consumed, if these
sugars and starches are not supplied in
other food, the fats in the peanut butter
are consumed for energy. If starches <em>are</em>
consumed in other foods, it is clear that one
who wishes to reduce in flesh should avoid
peanut butter, as well as other fats.</p>

<p>Peanut butter is more easily digested
than the baked peanut, unless the latter is
chewed to a pulp. It can be made at home
by grinding the peanuts in a meat grinder
and then further mashing with a rolling
pin or a potato masher. A little lemon
juice mixed with the peanut butter makes
it not only more palatable, but more easily
digested. A peanut butter sandwich is
quite as nourishing as a meat sandwich.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Shelled Peas.</b> Shelled peas were used
in Europe as far back as in the Middle
ages, and there, to-day, the dried or
“split” pea is used quite as extensively as
the dried bean. In America, peas are used
almost entirely in the green stage, fresh or
canned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span></p>

<p>As seen by Table VIII, the green, shelled
pea contains seven per cent protein and
sixteen per cent sugar and starch, while
the dry or “split” pea contains over
twenty-four and a half per cent protein
and sixty-two per cent sugar and starch,
the difference being in the amount of water
in the shelled peas. Canned peas contain
even a larger per cent of water.</p>

<p>A variety of green peas is now being
cultivated in which the pod of the pea is
used, just as the pod of the string bean. It
is a sweet and delicious side dish.</p>

<p><em>Dry Peas</em> are used in this country only
by boiling, putting through a sieve, and
serving as pureé.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Beans.</b> Baked navy beans may well be
substituted on a menu for meat, containing,
as they do, twenty-two and one half
per cent protein. It is needless to state that
beans and lean meat or eggs should not
be served at the same meal. Beans have
the advantage of being cheaper than meat,
yet, as stated above, the protein in the legumes
is less easily digested than the protein
of meat or eggs. They must be thoroughly
cooked and thoroughly masticated.</p>

<p>There is but a small percentage of fat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
in dried beans and for this reason they are
usually baked with a piece of pork. They
make a very complete, perhaps the most
complete food, containing nutrient elements
in about the proper proportions.
Effort has been made to make a bean
cracker for the sustenance of soldiers on
a march, thus giving them a complete food
in condensed form.</p>

<p>In baking dried beans or peas, soft or
distilled water should be used, as the lime
of hard water makes the shell almost indigestible.
For the same reason salt should
be added when the beans are nearly done.
If soft water is not obtainable, add a little
baking soda, in the proportion of a half
a teaspoon to two quarts of water.</p>

<p><em>String Beans.</em> The string bean contains
very little nutrient elements, as shown by
Table VIII. The pod and the bean, at this
unripe stage, are nearly ninety per cent
water. Their chief value as a food consists
of their appetizing quality to those
who are fond of them, thus stimulating the
flow of gastric juice. Like all green vegetables,
they stimulate the action of the kidneys.
For this reason all green vegetables
are particularly valuable to those who
drink little water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span></p>

<p><em>Lima Beans.</em> The dry, shelled bean,
used during the winter, boiled and baked
is the lima bean.</p>

<p><em>Kidney Beans</em> contain much water but
are more nutritious than the string bean.</p>

<p><em>Soy Bean.</em> In China and Japan this
bean is used extensively. Being rich in
protein, it makes a well balanced diet with
rice.</p>

<p>The soy bean is made into various preparations,
one of the most important being
<em>shoyo</em>, now being introduced into other
countries. To make it, the soy bean is
cooked and mixed with roasted wheat flour
and salt; into this is put a special ferment.
It is then allowed to stand for years in
casks. The result is a thick, brown liquid
with a pungent, agreeable taste. It is very
nourishing.</p>

<p>A kind of cheese is also made from boiling
the soy bean for several hours, then
wrapping the hot mass in bundles of straw,
and putting it in a tightly closed cellar for
twenty-four hours.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Lentils</b> are not commonly used in this
country, but they were one of the earliest
vegetables to be cultivated in Asia and the
Mediterranean countries. They are imported
and are found only in the best markets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
of large cities. They are used in the
menu like dried peas and are fully as nourishing,
but the flavor of the lentil is pronounced
and they are not as agreeable to
the average person as peas or beans.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Nuts</div>

<p>Nuts are classed with the carbo-nitrogenous
foods, because of the more nearly
equal proportion of proteins and carbonaceous
substances.</p>

<p>It will be noted, by reference to the
table, that nuts contain a much larger proportion
of fats and less starch than the
legumes. Chestnuts contain the largest
amount of starch, pecans the most fat, and
roasted peanuts the most protein.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span></p>

<p>Nuts are a valuable food, but they should
be made a part of a meal and may well
take the place of meat, because of the large
percentage of protein, rather than to be
eaten as a dessert. They are too hearty
to eat at the end of a meal, after one has
eaten as much other food as the system
requires. In planning a meal, if the dietary
is rich in starches and lacking in protein,
a side dish of nuts may be served.</p>

<p>Too great stress cannot be laid upon the
importance of the thorough mastication
of nuts; otherwise they are difficult of digestion.
When thoroughly chewed, however,
they are as easily digested as cereals
or legumes. If ground fine in a meat
grinder or through a sieve, they digest
more readily, but this grinding does not
take the place of the grinding with the
teeth and the mixing with saliva. They are
best ground for salads, cake or croquettes.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Milk</div>

<p>Milk is called a complete food. It is a
perfect food for the sustenance of its
own species,—the milk of the cow for the
calf, the mother’s milk for the infant; yet
the milk of the cow is not perfect for the
child,—it is lacking in the proper proportion
of sugar, and when fed to the child a
little sugar is added.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span></p>

<p>There has been a tendency among certain
classes, to recommend an all-milk diet,
because the proteins, carbohydrates and
fats are in proportion to sustain life indefinitely,
but experiments have shown that
healthy, digestive organs do their work
better when a part of the food is solid.
Moreover, if an all-milk diet were followed,
the adult, in order to get sufficient nutriment,
would be compelled to take a larger
proportion of water than necessary, the
proportion of water required by the system
being about sixty-seven per cent, while
milk contains eighty-seven per cent.</p>

<p>In order for the adult to get the proper
quantity of carbohydrates and fat, from
an all-milk diet, it would be necessary to
drink from four to five quarts of milk a
day (sixteen to twenty glasses). Therefore,
although an exceedingly valuable
food, containing nutriment elements for
repair and to supply heat and energy for
an indefinite time, <em>milk is not a desirable,
perfect food for an adult</em>.</p>

<p>If the mother’s milk contains eighty-seven
per cent water it seems not too much
for the infant. Young babies, on a milk
diet, are almost always fat. This is not
because the fats, sugars and starches are
in too large a proportion to the protein,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
but it bears out the theory, which is fully
demonstrated in actual experiments of the
writer with over twenty thousand women,
that the free drinking of liquid at a meal
aids digestion and a better absorption and
assimilation of food.</p>

<p>One advantage of drinking milk with the
meal, is that it is not taken as cold as water
and it supplies a portion of actual food.</p>

<p>Reference to the above table shows that
the thirteen per cent of organic foods are
about equally divided between fat, sugar
and protein. The protein is <em>casein</em>. There
is no starch in milk. The digestive ferment,
which acts upon starch, has not developed
in the young babe and the infant
cannot digest starch. The salts promote
the growth of bone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span></p>

<p>The fat in milk is in small emulsified
droplets within a thin albuminous sheath.
When allowed to stand in a cool place it
rises to the top.</p>

<p>Besides casein, there is a certain amount
of albumen in milk,—about one-seventh of
the total amount. This is called lactalbumin.</p>

<p>A part of the digestion of the casein is
performed by pepsin in the stomach and a
part by the trypsin of the pancreatic juice.</p>

<p><em>Digestion of Milk.</em> The larger part of
the digestion of the milk sugar is performed
by the pancreatic juice; yet it is
partly acted upon by the saliva. There is
little chance for the saliva to act upon the
milk sugar in the mouth, however, as very
little saliva is mixed with the milk. This
constitutes another objection to the diet
of all milk, and is an argument in favor of
drinking milk slowly and holding it in the
mouth until it is mixed with saliva. It is
one reason, also, why children should be
given bread broken in the milk, instead of
a piece of bread and a glass of milk. By
swallowing the milk slowly, the curds
formed in the stomach are smaller and the
milk is more thoroughly digested.</p>

<p>When the fat (cream) is removed milk
digests more readily, so that in case of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
delicate stomachs <em>skimmed milk, clabbered
milk or buttermilk</em> are often prescribed
instead of sweet milk. Boiled milk is also
more easily digested by some because of
the lactalbumin which is separated and
rises to the top in a crinky skum. The
casein is also more readily digested in
boiled milk, forming in small flakes in the
stomach instead of in curds.</p>

<p>When one takes from two to three
glasses of milk at a meal, less solid food
is needed, because the required nutriment
is partially supplied with the milk. One
reason why milk seemingly disagrees with
many people, is because they lose sight of
the fact that milk is an actual food, as
well as a beverage and they eat the same
quantity of food in addition to the milk
that they eat if drinking water. This is
the reason that milk seems to make some
people bilious and causes constipation.
It is due to too much food rather than to
any quality in the milk.</p>

<p>Constipation may be occasioned by
drinking milk rapidly so that large curds
are formed by the acids in the stomach,
rendering it difficult of digestion. The
constipating effect will be overcome by
lessening the quantity of food and by the
addition of limewater to the milk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span></p>

<p>To prepare limewater put a heaping
teaspoon of slaked lime into a quart of
boiled or distilled water; put into a corked
bottle and shake thoroughly two or three
times during the first hour. Then allow
the lime to settle, and after twenty-four
hours pour or siphon off the clear fluid.</p>

<p>Barley water or oatmeal water added to
milk also prevent the formation of curds.</p>

<p>In young babes the milk is curdled, or
the casein separated from the water and
sugar, not by hydrochloric acid, but by a
ferment in the gastric juice, known as rennin.
It is the rennin, or rennet, from the
stomachs of young calves and young pigs,
which is used to coagulate the casein in
cheese factories.</p>

<p>Milk is coagulated or curdled by many
fruit and vegetable acids, as the housewife
well knows, using milk in pies containing
certain acid fruits, such as lemons,
or in soup containing tomatoes. The hydrochloric
acid of the stomach at once
causes a similar coagulation, though the
curds are tougher and more leathery. The
milk forms into curds immediately upon
entering the stomach. This is the natural
process of milk digestion and is the chief
reason why it should be drunk slowly,
otherwise the curds will form in too large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
sizes, thus pressing upon the entrance to
the stomach and causing distress. The
tough, large curds formed by the hydrochloric
acid, are difficult for invalids or for
very delicate stomachs to digest.</p>

<p>If an alkali, such as limewater, is
added, to neutralize the acids of the stomach,
the curds do not form, or are re-dissolved,
and digestion is aided. One sixth
limewater to five-sixths milk is the proper
proportion.</p>

<p><em>Milk Tests.</em> In testing the value of milk,
or the value of a cow, butter makers and
farmers gauge it by the amount of butter
fat in the milk, while the cheese maker tests
the milk for the proportion of protein
(casein). The amount of butter fat depends
upon the feed and water, and upon
the breed. The milk from Jersey and
Guernsey cows yields about five per cent
butter fat. If the total nutrient elements
fall below twelve per cent, it is safe to assume
that the milk has been watered.</p>

<p>In cheese and butter there is no sugar;
it remains in the buttermilk and the whey,
both of which the farmer takes home from
the factories to fatten his hogs.</p>

<p><em>Preserving Milk.</em> Many forms of bacteria
thrive in milk and it is needless to
say that the utmost cleanliness should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
observed on the part of the dairyman in
the care and cleanliness of his cows, in the
cleanliness of the milk receptacles, and in
the place in which the milk is allowed to
stand over night. Care and cleanliness in
the home is quite as important.</p>

<p>If milk could be kept free from bacteria,
it would keep sweet almost indefinitely.
At the Paris Exposition, milk from several
American dairies was kept sweet for two
weeks, without any preservative, except
cleanliness and a temperature of about
forty degrees. The United States Bureau
of Animal Industry states that milk may
be kept sweet for seven weeks without the
use of chemicals.</p>

<p>The best method for the housewife to
follow is to keep the milk clean, cool, and
away from other foods.</p>

<p><em>Pasteurized Milk.</em> In pasteurizing milk
the aim is to destroy as many of the bacteria
as possible without causing any chemical
changes or without changing the flavor.
One can pasteurize milk at home by
placing it in an air tight bottle, immersing
the bottle to the neck in hot water, heating
the water to one hundred and forty-nine
degrees F for a half hour and then quickly
cooling the milk to fifty degrees, by immersing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
the bottle in cold water. The
rapid cooling lessens the cooked taste.
Many of the best dairies pasteurize the
milk in this way before it is marketed.</p>

<p><em>Sterilized Milk.</em> Milk is sterilized to destroy
all bacteria, by boiling it. It must
sometimes be boiled one, two or three successive
days. Sterilized milk remains
sweet longer than pasteurized milk, but
more chemical changes are produced and
the flavor is changed.</p>

<p>Formerly borax, boric acid, salicylic
acid, formalin and salt petre were used to
keep the milk sweet, but this adulteration
is now forbidden by the pure food laws.</p>

<p><em>Malted Milk</em> is a dry, soluble food product
in powder form, derived from barley
malt, wheat flour and cows milk, with the
full amount of cream.</p>

<p>The process of the extraction from the
cereals is conducted at elevated temperatures
so as to allow the active agents
(enzymes) of the barley malt to affect the
conversion of the vegetable protein and
starches. The filtered extract, containing
the derivatives of the malt, wheat and
the full-cream cows milk, is then evaporated
to dryness in vacuo, the temperature
being controlled so as to obviate any alteration
of the natural constituents of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
ingredients and so as to preserve their full
physiological values. The strictest precautions
are observed to insure the purity
of the product. It contains,</p>

<p>It is free from germs, the starches and
sugars being converted in the process of
manufacture in maltose, dextrine and lactose.
The fats are in an absorbable condition,
and it contains a high percentage of
proteins derived from both the milk and
the grains, as well as a marked percentage
of mineral salts. It is readily soluble in
water and is easily digested.</p>

<p><em>Smierkase</em>, made in the home, is coagulated
casein. It contains thirty-three
per cent protein, twenty-four per cent fat
and five per cent salts. The thickening
of the milk, or the coagulation of the casein,
is like that produced by lactic acid.</p>

<p><em>Skimmed Milk</em>, as shown by the table,
contains the same amount of protein as
fresh milk, but more sugar and more ash,
the difference consisting almost entirely of
less fat, which has been removed in the
cream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span></p>

<p><em>Buttermilk.</em> There is less fat, protein,
sugar or ash in buttermilk than in skimmed
milk; it is therefore less nourishing but
more easily digested. The sugar has partially
fermented and the free lactic acid
gives the pungent taste. Buttermilk made
by lactone tablets and fresh milk is as
nourishing and as desirable as that made
in the process of butter making, and it has
the advantage of being fresh.</p>

<p><em>Clabbered Milk.</em> The casein in clabbered
milk coagulates, and, if kept in a hot place,
the coagulation continues until the water,
sugar and salt are separated. This is the
whey, which is fed to hogs,—the sugar fattens
them.</p>

<p><em>Milk Sugar.</em> Sugar made from milk is
now a commercial factor; it is evaporated
and compressed into a fine powder. This
powder is used by physicians and druggists
in mixing powders, pills, tablets, etc.</p>

<p><em>Milk Junket.</em> The junket tablets, used in
milk junket, are milk coagulated by rennet.
Flavored milk coagulated by rennet, has
not the sour taste of milk coagulated by
acid.</p>

<p><em>Condensed Milk</em> is made by evaporating
the water until the milk is reduced to about
one fourth its volume. It is then sterilized
and hermetically sealed. It is convenient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
for use, wherever fresh milk cannot be obtained,
but the process of evaporation
changes its flavor so that few care for it
as a drink. It makes a good substitute for
cream in coffee, and diluted with three
times its volume in water, it is again of
the same constituency as before the water
was evaporated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tea</div>

<p>Tea is made by steeping the leaves of a
shrub, which grows in the tropical
regions of Asia and adjacent islands. The
green tea comes from China and Japan
and the darker varieties from India and
Ceylon.</p>

<p>It should never be boiled nor allowed to
stand longer than a few minutes, as standing
in water causes tannin to be extracted
from the leaves, and this tannin disturbs
digestion. It is the tannin extracted from
the bark of trees which toughens animal
skins into leather. The best way to make
tea is to pour on boiling water and serve
almost immediately, or at least within five
to ten minutes.</p>

<p>Because of the uncertainty as to the
length of time tea may be allowed to steep
in hotel kitchens or restaurants, it is a
wise custom to have a ball of tea and a pot
of hot water served that the guest may
make the tea at the table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span></p>

<p>Tea, as well as coffee, is diuretic—stimulating
the action of the kidneys. It is not
a <em>food</em>; it is a <em>stimulant</em>.</p>

<p><em>Thein</em>, which is the ingredient for which
tea is drunk, is chemically identical with
caffein in coffee.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Coffee</div>

<p>Coffee is a beverage, prepared from
the seeds of the coffee tree. The best
known brands come from the Island of
Java, Mocha, Rio de Janeiro, and Mexico.</p>

<p>Coffee <em>is not a food</em>. The active principle
is caffein. This is an alkaloid and is
a strong stimulant to the central nervous
system. It quickens the heart action, and,
unless the heart be weak, one does not need
so strong a stimulant. The stimulating
effect is so apparent with many, that they
cannot sleep for several hours after drinking
it. Others drink coffee to quicken mental
activity and to keep them awake.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind, however, that
there is a reactionary effect from all stimulants,
and while coffee is not intoxicating,
as alcohol, it has a similar effect upon the
nerves and heart. It is given to those addicted
to liquor, as a milder stimulant,
when they are recovering from a spell of
intoxication.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span></p>

<p>Whether because of the strong stimulant,
or because of some chemical effect of
caffein, coffee retards digestion, especially
when the digestive organs are weak. It
has the redeeming feature, of having a
pleasing aroma, which, because of the effect
upon the mind, may incite the flow of
gastric juice; but, despite the fact that no
morning beverage has quite the same
pleasing aroma, or pungency, as coffee,
one is much better without it.</p>

<p>One who knows that coffee disturbs his
digestion and yet cannot break himself
from the habit of drinking it, should have
sympathy for the one who is addicted to
liquor and finds it difficult to break the
habit of depending upon this <em>so-called</em>
stimulant.</p>

<p><em>Cocoa and Chocolate</em> are prepared

from the shell of the bean and
chocolate from the kernel. As shown by
Table VII, they are more nutritious than
the other beverages; yet the fat in chocolate
is not like the fat in other foods. It
is not used as a reserve in animal tissue
as are the other fats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span></p>

<p>The active principle in cocoa and chocolate
is <em>theobromin</em> and is similar to caffein
in its stimulating effect upon the nervous
system, though milder.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lemonade</div>

<p><em>Lemonade</em> and other fruit drinks,
particularly those made from the

<p>All fruit drinks are diuretic, and, wherever
the action of the kidneys is sluggish,
they are especially desirable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Carbonized
Drinks</div>

<p>are made from bottling some

</div>


<p>Without doubt, highly spiced foods are
undesirable. They tend to weaken digestion,
by calling for an undue secretion of
digestive juices, which, if prolonged, tires
out the glands. A reasonable amount of
condiments such as pepper, nutmeg, cloves,
allspice, sage, thyme, ginger, mustard, cinnamon,
mace, horseradish, vanilla, dill,
etc., may be used as appetizers, because the
pleasing thought of them may incite the
flow of gastric juice; but if one has not cultivated
a taste for them this thought will
not be pleasing and they are then better
omitted from the diet. The taste is undoubtedly
a cultivated one, and should not
be encouraged in children. The child rarely
cares for condiments and it is better that
he continue to relish his food for its natural
flavor.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PRESERVATION_OF_FOODS">PRESERVATION OF FOODS</h2>
</div>


<p>All food for preservation should be kept
in a clean, cool, dry, dark place. Reduction
in temperature to near freezing, and
removal of moisture and air stop bacterial
development.</p>

<p>Drying, cooking, and sealing from the
air will preserve some meats and fruits,
while others require such preservatives as
sugar, vinegar and salt. The preservative
in vinegar is acetic acid.</p>

<p>All preservatives which are actual foods,
such as sugar, salt and vinegar, are to be
recommended, but the use of antiseptic preservatives,
such as salicylic acid, formaldehyd,
boracic acid, alum, sulphur and benzonate
of soda, all of which have been used
by many canning merchants, is frought
with danger. The United States Department
of Agriculture holds, that by
the use of such preservatives, unscrupulous
dealers may use fruits and vegetables
not in good condition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span></p>

<p>There can be no doubt that, wherever
possible, the best method for the housewife
to preserve food is to do her own drying,
canning, preserving and pickling of
fruits and vegetables, which she knows are
fresh, putting up her own preserves, jams,
jellies, pickles, syrups, grape juice, etc.</p>

<p>Since economy in food lies in the least
amount of money for the greatest amount
of nutriment, the preparation of simple
foods in the home, with a care that no more
is furnished for consumption than the system
requires, is the truest economy in
health and in doctor’s bills.</p>

<p>It is not more brands of prepared food
which are needed, but purity of elements
in their natural state. A dish of wholesome,
clean oat meal has more nourishment
and more fuel value than the average prepared
food.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>In the effort to emphasize the importance
of pure food in amount and quality,
pure air and pure water must not be overlooked.
Much infection is carried by these
two elements. Pure air, containing a normal

the foods consumed.</em></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="COOKING">COOKING</h2>
</div>


<p>The cooking of food is as important as
its selection, because the manner of cooking
makes it easier or more difficult of digestion.
The question of the proper selection
and cooking of food is so vital to the health
and resultant happiness of every family,
and to the strength and well being of a
nation, that every woman, to whom the
cooking for a family is entrusted, should
have special preparation for her work, and
every girl should be given practical and
theoretical training in Dietetics in our public
schools. The study is as dignified as
the study of music and art. Indeed it can
be made an art in the highest conception
of the term. Surely the education of every
girl in the vocation, in which she sooner or
later must engage, either actively or by
directing others, means more than education
in music and drawing. We must all
eat two and three times every day; there
are few things which we do so regularly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
and which are so vital; yet in the past we
have given this subject less study than any
common branch in our schools. When the
dignity of the profession of dietetics is
realized, the servant problem will be
largely solved.</p>

<p>In cooking any food, heat and moisture
are necessary, the time varying from
thirty minutes to several hours, according
to different foods. Baked beans and meats
containing much connective tissue, as boiling
and roasting cuts, require the longest
time.</p>

<p>The purposes in the cooking of foods
are: the development of the flavor, which
makes the food appetizing, thus encouraging
the flow of gastric juice; the sterilization,
thereby killing all parasites and
micro-organisms, such as the tape worm
in beef, pork, and mutton, and the trichinae
in pork; the conversion of the nutrients
into a more digestible form, by partially
or wholly converting the connective
tissue into gelatin.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Cooking
of Meats</div>

<p>The fundamental principle to be observed
in the cooking of meat concerns
the retention of the juices,
since these contain a large part of
the nutrition. The heat develops the flavor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
and the moisture, together with the
heat, dissolves the connective tissue and
makes it tender.</p>

<p>A choice piece of meat may be toughened
and made difficult of digestion, or a tough
piece may be made tender and easy to
digest, by the manner of cooking.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Soups.</b> To make meat soups, the connective
tissue, bone and muscle should be put
into cold water, brought <em>slowly</em> to the boiling
point and allowed to simmer for hours.
It must be remembered that the gelatin
from this connective tissue does not contain
the tissue building elements of the albuminoids.
These are retained in what
meat may be about the bones of the boiling
piece and in the blood.</p>

<p>The albumin of meat is largely in the
blood and it is the coagulated blood which
forms the scum on soup, if heated above
a certain point; the cook should boil the
soup slowly, or much of the nutrition is lost
in the coagulated blood, or skum.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Roasting.</b> The flavor and juice of the
meat is best retained by roasting. If it is
put into a hot oven, with a little suet over
the top, so as to sear the meat with hot
fat, and no water is put in the pan, it will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
retain the juice and the flavor. Water
draws out the extractives.</p>

<p>It is important to remember that the
smaller the cut to be roasted, the hotter
should be the fire. An intensely hot fire
coagulates the exterior and prevents the
drying up of the meat juice. After the surface
is coagulated and seared it should cook
slowly.</p>

<p>Unless the oven is sufficiently hot to sear
the surface, the moisture, or juice, will escape
into the roasting pan and the connective
tissue will be toughened. A roast
should be cooked in a covered roaster to
retain the moisture.</p>

<p>The roast should be turned as soon as
one side is seared and just sufficient water
put into the pan to keep it from burning.</p>

<p>Frequent basting of a roast, with the fat,
juice, and water in the roasting pan, still
further sears the surface, so that the juices
do not seep through and keeps the air in
the pan moist; the heated moisture materially
assists in gelatinizing the connective
tissue,—roasting pans are now made which
are self-basting.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Broiling.</b> The same principle applies to
broiling as to roasting. The meat is put
over a very hot flame and turned so as to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
quickly sear both sides, to prevent the juice
from oozing out. In fact, the best broiled
steaks are turned just as soon as the juice
begins to drip, so as to retain all juice in
the meat.</p>

<p>Meat containing much connective tissue
is not adapted to broiling, because it takes
too long for this tissue to become gelatinized.</p>

<p>Steak broiled in a skillet, especially
round steak which has been pounded to
assist in breaking the connective tissue, is
often first dipped in seasoned flour, which
is rubbed well into it. The flour absorbs
the meat juices so that none of them are
lost. All meats broiled in skillets should
be put into a very hot skillet and one surface
seared, then should be turned so as
to sear the other side. The skillet should
be kept covered so as to retain the moisture.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Boiling.</b> In boiling meat, where the object
is to eat the tissue itself, it should be
put into hot water, that the albumin on
the surface may be immediately coagulated
and prevent the escape of the nutrients
into the water. It is impossible to
make a rich broth and to have a juicy,
highly flavored piece of boiled meat at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
same time. Meat is best roasted or broiled
when the meat tissue is to be eaten.</p>

<p>The boiling cuts contain more connective
tissue, therefore they require a much
longer time to cook in order to gelatinize
this tissue. They are not as rich in protein
as the steaks.</p>

<p>Meat soups, bouillons and broths contain
very little nutriment, but they do contain
the extractives, and the flavors increase
the flow of digestive juices and
stimulate the appetite. It is for this reason
that soups are served before a meal
rather than for a dessert; they insure
a copious flow of gastric juice and saliva
to act upon the crackers or toast eaten
with the soup. Many mistake the extractives
and flavor for nourishment, feeling
that the soups are an easy method of taking
food, but the best part of the nutriment
remains in the meat or vegetables making
the soup.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Pot Roasts.</b> In the case of a pot roast,
or roast in a kettle, where it is desirable to
use both the fibre of the meat and the juice,
or gravy, it should be put into a little cold
water and raised to about 180 degrees F.,
where it should be kept for some hours.
The juices of the meat seep out in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
gravy. The extractives are simmered down
and are again poured over the meat in the
rich gravy.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Frying.</b> This is the least desirable
method of cooking. Food cooked by putting
a little grease into a frying pan, such
as fried potatoes, mush, eggs, french toast,
and griddle cakes, are more difficult of digestion
than foods cooked by any other
means, particularly where the fat is allowed
to smoke. The fat is superheated;
if a lighted match is placed near the smoke
it will catch fire, showing that it is volatilizing,
or being reduced to a vapor.</p>

<p>The extreme heat liberates fatty acids.
This acrid fat soaks into the food and renders
it difficult of digestion. It is wise
not to employ this method of cooking.</p>

<p>The objection to frying does not hold so
strongly in the case of vegetables, such as
potatoes, if fried <em>slowly</em> in fat, that is not
over heated, or to griddle cakes cooked
slowly without smoke, or to foods immersed
in grease (such as saratoga chips, doughnuts,
french fried potatoes, etc.), as the
large amount of fat does not permit it to
get so heated. It does apply, however, if
the fat is sufficiently heated to smoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span></p>

<p>The coating of vegetables and cereals
with the hot fat prevents the necessary
action of saliva upon the starch globules.
As previously stated, most of the starches
are digested in the mouth and the stomach,
while the fats are not emulsified until they
reach the intestines.</p>

<p>The starch globules in cereals and vegetables
are in the form of cells, the covering
of these cells being composed largely of
nitrogenous matter. The protein is not
acted upon by the saliva, and the nitrogenous
matter is largely digested in the
stomach. It is more easily dissolved if it
is broken or softened by cooking, so that
the carbohydrates can come in contact with
the saliva, but if encased in fried fat, the
gastric juices cannot digest the protein
covering and the saliva cannot reach the
starch until the fat is emulsified in the intestines.
This means that wherever starch
globules are surrounded with fat, the digestive
ferments reach these globules with
difficulty and fried foods must be digested
mostly in the intestines.</p>

<p>Fats are readily absorbed in their natural
condition, but when subject to extreme
heat, as in frying, they are irritants. For
this reason, eggs, poached, boiled or baked
are more easily digested than fried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span></p>

<p><em>Boiling, broiling and roasting are preferable
to foods cooked in fats.</em></p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Cooking
of Cereals</div>

<p>One safe rule for the cook is, that it
is better to cook most foods too
much than too little; overcooking is
uncommon and harmless, while <em>under</em>cooked
foods are common and difficult of
digestion.</p>

<p>In partially cooked cereals, one does not
know how much of the cooking has been
done, but it is safe to cook all such foods
at least as long as specified in the directions.</p>

<p>One reason why breakfast foods, such as
rolled oats, are partially cooked, is because
they keep longer.</p>

<p>As has been stated, the nutrients of the
grain are found inside the starch-bearing
and other cells, and the walls of these cells
are made of crude fiber, on which the digestive
juices have little effect. Unless the
cell walls are broken down, the nutrients
can not come under the influence of the
digestive juices until the digestive organs
have expended material and energy in trying
to get at them. Crushing the grain in
mills, and making it still finer by thorough
mastication breaks many of the cell walls,
and the action of the saliva and other digestive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
juices also disintegrates them more
or less, but the heat of cooking accomplishes
the object much more thoroughly.
The invisible moisture in the cells expands
under the action of heat, and the cell walls
burst. The water added in cooking also
plays an important part in softening and
rupturing them. Then, too, the cellulose
itself may be changed by heat to more
soluble form. Heat also makes the starch
in the cells at least partially soluble, especially
when water is present. The solubility
of the protein is probably, as a rule,
somewhat lessened by cooking, especially
at higher temperatures. Long, slow cooking
is therefore better, as it breaks down
the crude fiber and changes the starch
to soluble form without materially decreasing
the solubility of the protein.</p>

<p>“In experiments made with rolled oats
at the Minnesota Experiment Station, it
appeared that cooking (four hours) did not
make the starch much more soluble. However,
it so changed the physical structure
of the grains that a given amount of digestive
ferment could render much more of
it soluble in a given time than when it was
cooked for only half an hour.</p>

<p>“On the basis of the results obtained,
the difficulty commonly experienced in digesting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
imperfectly cooked oatmeal was attributed
to the large amounts of glutinous
material which surrounds the starch grains
and prevent their disintegration. When
thoroughly cooked the protecting action of
the mucilaginous protein is overcome, and
the compound starch granules are sufficiently
disintegrated to allow the digestive
juices to act. In other words, the increased
digestibility of the thoroughly cooked cereal
is supposed to be largely due to a physical
change in the carbohydrates, which
renders them more susceptible to the action
of digestive juices.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Pastry.</b> Pastry owes its harmful character
to the interference of fat as shown
on page <a href="#Page_198">198</a>, with the proper solution of
the starch,—at least such pastry as requires
the mixing of flour with fat; the
coating of these granules with fat prevents
them from coming in contact with liquids;
the cells cannot absorb water, swell and
burst so that they may dissolve. The
fat does not furnish sufficient water for
this and so coats the starch granules as to
prevent the absorption of water in mixing,
or of the saliva in mastication. This coating
of fat is not relieved until late in the
process of digestion, or until the food<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
reaches the intestines. This same objection
applies to rich gravies, unless the flour
be dissolved in water and heated before
being mixed with the fats. The objection,
therefore, is to such pastry as is made by
mixing flour with fat, as in pie crust; it
does not apply to most puddings.</p>

<p>Heat, in cooking, causes a combustion of
the carbonic acid gas and the effort of this
gas to escape, as well as the steam occasioned
by the water in the food, causes the
bubbles. When beaten eggs are used, the
albuminoids in the bubbles expand the
walls, which stiffen with the heat and
cause the substances containing eggs to
be porous.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Cooking of
Vegetables</div>

<p>Since the root vegetables contain a
large proportion of carbohydrates,
they should be well cooked, in
order that the cells may be fully dissolved,
and the crude fibre broken.</p>

<p>Vegetables are best cooked in soft water,
as lime or magnesia, the chemical ingredients
which make water “hard”, make the
vegetables less soluble.</p>

<p>Vegetables and fruits become contaminated
with the eggs of numerous parasites
from the fertilizers used; hence they should
be thoroughly washed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span></p>

<p>The objection to frying meats are
equally strong in regard to vegetables.
The coating of vegetables with the hot fat
retards digestion, as shown on page <a href="#Page_198">198</a>.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Cooking
of Fruit</div>

<p>“In different countries opinions differ
markedly regarding the relative wholesomeness
of raw and cooked fruit.
The Germans use comparatively little raw
fruit and consider it far less wholesome
than cooked fruit. On the other hand, in
the United States raw fruit of good quality
is considered extremely wholesome, and
is used in very large quantities, being as
much relished as cooked fruit, if indeed it
is not preferred to it. It has been suggested
that the European prejudice against
raw fruit may be an unconscious protest
against unsanitary methods of marketing
or handling and the recognition of cooking
as a practical method of preventing the
spread of disease by fruit, accidentally
soiled with fertilizers in the fields or with
street dust.</p>

<p>“As in the case with all vegetable foods,
the heat of cooking breaks down the carbohydrate
walls of the cells which make up
the fruit flesh, either because the moisture
or other cell contents expand and rupture
the walls or because the cell wall is itself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
softened or dissolved. Texture, appearance,
and flavor of fruit are materially
modified by cooking, and, if thorough, it
insures sterilization, as in the case of all
other foods. The change in texture often
has a practical advantage, since it implies
the softening of the fruit flesh so that it
is more palatable and may be more readily
acted upon by the digestive juices. This is
obviously of more importance with the
fruits like the quince, which is so hard that
it is unpalatable raw, than it is with soft
fruits like strawberries. When fruits are
cooked without the addition of water or
other material, as is often the case in baking
apples, there is a loss of weight, owing
to the evaporation of water, and the juice
as it runs out carries some carbohydrates
and other soluble constituents with it, but
under ordinary household conditions this
does not imply waste, as the juice which
cooks out from fruits is usually eaten as
well as the pulp. Cooking in water extracts
so little of the nutritive material
present that such removal of nutrition is
of no practical importance.</p>

<p>“The idea is quite generally held that
cooking fruit changes its acid content, acid
being sometimes increased and sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
decreased by the cooking process. Kelhofer
showed that when gooseberries were
cooked with sugar, the acid content was
not materially changed, these results being
in accord with his conclusions reached in
earlier studies with other fruits. The
sweeter taste of the cooked product he
believed to be simply due to the fact that
sugar masks the flavor of the acid.</p>

<p>“It is often noted that cooked fruits,
such as plums, seem much sourer than the
raw fruit, and it has been suggested that
either the acid was increased or the sugar
was decreased by the cooking process. This
problem was studied by Sutherst, and, in
his opinion, the increased acid flavor is
due to the fact that cooked fruit (gooseberries,
currants, plums, etc.) usually contains
the skin, which is commonly rejected
if the fruit is eaten raw. The skin is more
acid than the simpler carbohydrates united
to form a complex carbohydrate. In some
fruits, like the apple, where the jelly-yielding
material must be extracted with hot
water, the pectin is apparently united with
cellulose as a part of the solid pulp. As
shown by the investigations of Bigelow
and Gore at the Bureau of Chemistry, 40
per cent of the solid material of apple pulp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
may be thus extracted with hot water, and
consists of two carbohydrates, one of which
is closely related to gum arabic. That
such carbohydrates as these should yield
a jelly is not surprising when we remember
that they are similar to starch in their
chemical nature, and, as every one knows,
starch, though insoluble in cold water,
yields when cooked with hot water a large
proportion of paste, which jellies on cooling.</p>

<p>“When fruits are used for making pies,
puddings, etc., the nutritive value of the
dish is, of course, increased by the addition
of flour, sugar, etc., and the dish as a
whole may constitute a better balanced
food than the fruit alone.”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>As previously stated, the object of foods
is to supply the needs of the body in building
new tissue in the growing child; in
repairing tissue which the catabolic activity
of the body is constantly tearing down
and eliminating; and in supplying heat and
energy. This heat and energy is not alone
for muscular activity in exercise or movement;
it must be borne in mind that the
body is a busy work-shop, or chemical laboratory,
and heat and energy are needed
in the constant metabolism of tearing down
and rebuilding tissue and in the work of
digestion and elimination.</p>

<p>In this chapter, a few points given in the
preceding pages are repeated for emphasis.
The proteins, represented in purest
form in lean meat, build tissue and the carbonaceous
foods, starches, sugars and fats,
supply the heat and energy. An excess of
proteins, that is more than is needed for
building and repair, is also used for heat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
and energy; the waste products of the
nitrogenous foods are broken down into
carbon dioxid, sulphates, phosphates, and
other nitrogenous compounds and excreted
through the kidneys, skin, and the bile,
while the waste product of carbonaceous
foods is carbon dioxid alone and is excreted
mostly through the lungs.</p>

<p>Since the foods richest in protein are the
most expensive, those who wish to keep
down the cost of living, should provide, at
most, no more protein than the system requires.
The expensive meat may be eliminated
and proteins be supplied by eggs,
milk, legumes, nuts and cereals.</p>

<p>The most fundamental thing is to decide
upon the amount of protein—two to four
ounces, nearly a quarter of a pound a day—and
then select a dietary which shall provide
this and also supply heat and energy
sufficient for the day. If the diet is to include
meat, a goodly proportion of protein
will be furnished in the lean meat. This
will vary greatly with the different cuts of
meat as shown on Table IV, page <a href="#Page_128">128</a>.
If, as often happens, one does not care for
fats, then the starches and sugars must
provide the heat. If one craves sweets,
less starches and fats are needed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span></p>

<p>The normally healthy individual is more
liable to supply too much protein than too
little, even though he abstain from meat.
Yet, as will be shown later, our strongest
races, who have lent most to the progress
of the world, live upon a mixed diet.</p>

<p>If the diet is to include meat, it will consist
of less bulk, because the protein is
more condensed; for the same reason, if it
includes animal products of eggs and milk
and a fair proportion of legumes, it will
be less bulky than a vegetable diet. This
point is important for busy people, who
eat their meals in a hurry and proceed at
once to active, mental work. Those who
engage in physical labor are much more
likely to take a complete rest for a half
hour, to an hour, after eating. The <em>thinkers</em>
seldom rest, at least after a midday meal,
and those who worry seldom relax the
mental force during any waking hours.</p>

<p>Where the system shows an excess of
uric acid, the chances are that the individual
has not been living on a diet with too
large a proportion of protein, but that he
has been eating more than he requires of
all kinds of foodstuffs. His system thus
becomes weakened and he does not breathe
deeply nor exercise sufficiently to oxidize
and throw off the waste. Let it be recalled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
here that the theory that rheumatism is
caused by an excess of uric acid is disputed
by the highest authorities. It is
<em>accompanied</em> by uric acid, but not supposed
to be caused by it.</p>

<p>Every housewife, to intelligently select
the daily menus for her family, needs a
thorough knowledge of dietetics. She
must understand the chemistry of food that
she may know food values. The difficulty
which confronts the housewife, is to provide
one meal suited to the needs, tastes,
or idiosyncracies of various members of
her household. Peculiarities of taste, unless
these peculiarities have been intelligently
acquired, may result in digestive
disturbances. As an illustration: one may
cultivate a dislike for meat, milk, or eggs,
as is often the case, and the proteins for
the family being largely supplied by these,
the individual is eating too much of
starches and sugars and not sufficient protein,—legumes,
nuts, etc., not being provided
for one member. Such an one’s
blood becomes impoverished and she becomes
anaemic.</p>

<p>The relief lies in <em>cultivating a taste</em> for
blood building foods. Foods which are
forced down, with a mind arrayed against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
them, do not digest as readily, because the
displeasure does not incite the flow of gastric
juices. One fortunate provision of
nature lies in the ability to cultivate a taste
for <em>any</em> food. Likes and dislikes are
largely mental. There are certain foods
which continuously disagree and they
should be avoided; but many abstain from
wholesome food because it has disagreed
a <em>few</em> times. It may be that it was not the
particular food but the weakness of the
stomach at this time. Any food fails of
prompt digestion when the nerves controlling
the stomach are weak.</p>

<p>Many foods disagree at certain times because
of the particular conditions regulating
the secretion of digestive juices. Where
this condition has continued for some time
it becomes chronic and a special diet is required,
together with special exercises to
bring a better blood supply to stomach and
intestines and to regulate the nerves controlling
them.</p>

<p>Dr. W. S. Hall estimates that the
average man at light work requires,
each day,</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="no-indent">
106.8 grams of protein<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a><br>
57.97 grams of fat<br>
398.84 grams of carbohydrates<br>
</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span></p>
<p>These elements, in proper proportions,
may be gained through many food combinations.
He gives the following:</p>


<table class="autotable" style="width: 40%">

<td class="tdl">Bread</td>
<td class="tdr">1 lb.</td>

<p>A medium sized man at out of door work,
fully oxidizes all waste of the system and
he requires a higher protein diet,—125
grams. In such event he does not require
so much starch and sugar. If on the other
hand he were to take but 106.8 grams of
protein, as above, he would require more
carbohydrates. One working, or exercising
in the fresh air, breathes more deeply
and oxidizes and eliminates more waste,
hence he has a better appetite, which is
simply the call of nature for a re-supply
of the waste.</p>

<p>In active work, one also liberates more
heat, thus more fat, starches, and sugar
are required for the re-supply. If one has
an excess of starch (glycogen) stored in
the liver, or an excess of fat about the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
tissues, this excess is called upon to supply
the heat and energy when the fats and carbohydrates
daily consumed are not sufficient
for the day’s demand. This is the
principle of reduction of flesh.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that habits of
combining foods are unconsciously based
upon dietetic principles. Meats rich in
protein are served with potatoes, or with
rice, both of which are rich in starch.
Bread, containing little fat, is served with
butter. Beans, containing little fat, are
cooked with pork. Starchy foods of all
kinds are served with butter or cream.
Macaroni, which is rich in starch, makes a
well balanced food cooked with cheese.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="no-indent">Pork and beans,<br>
bread and butter,<br>
bread and milk,<br>
chicken and rice,<br>
macaroni and cheese,<br>
poached eggs on toast, and<br>
custards, form balanced dishes.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>A knowledge of such combinations is
important when one must eat a hasty
luncheon and wishes to supply the demands
of the body in the least time, giving the
least thought to the selection; but hasty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
luncheons, with the mind concentrated
upon other things, are to be strongly condemned.
The mind must be relaxed and
directed to pleasant themes during a meal
or the nerves to the vital organs will be
held too tense to permit a free secretion of
digestive juices. Chronic indigestion is
sure to result from this practice. Dinner,
or the hearty meal at night, rather than at
noon, is preferable for the business or professional
man or woman, because the cares
of the day are over and the brain force
relaxes. The vital forces are not detracted
from the work of digestion.</p>

<p>Experiments in the quantity of food actually
required for body needs, made by
Prof. R. H. Chittenden of the Sheffield Scientific
School, Yale University, have established,
beyond doubt, the fact that the
average individual consumes very much
more food than the system requires. In
fact, most tables of food requirements, in
previous books on dietetics, have been
heavy.</p>

<p>Prof. Chittenden especially established
the fact that the average person consumes
more protein than is necessary to maintain
a nitrogenous balance. It was formerly
held that the average daily metabolism and
excretion of nitrogen through the kidneys<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
was 16 grams, or about 100 grams of protein
or albuminoid food. Prof. Chittenden’s
tests, covering a period of six
months, show an average daily excretion
of 5.86 grams of nitrogen, or a little less
than one-third of that formerly accepted
as necessary; 5.86 grams of nitrogen corresponds
to 36.62 grams of protein or
albuminoid food.</p>

<p>Prof. Chittenden’s experiments of the
foodstuffs actually required by three
groups of men, one group of United States
soldiers, a group from the Yale College
athletic team, and a group of college professors,
all showed that the men retained
full strength, with a higher degree of physical
and mental efficiency, when the body
was not supplied with more protein than
was liberated by metabolic activity, and
when the quantity of carbonaceous food
was regulated to the actual requirement to
retain body heat and furnish energy.</p>

<p>It may be well to call attention here to
the fact that the food elements, called upon
for work, are not from those foods just
consumed or digested, but from those eaten
a day or two previous, which have been
assimilated in the muscular tissues.</p>

<p>In selecting a diet, the individual must
be considered as to age, sex and physical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
condition, also whether active in indoor or
outdoor work, and whether he or she
breathes deeply, so as to take plenty of
fresh air into the lungs.</p>

<p>In order to bring oneself to as limited
a diet as Prof. Chittenden’s men followed,
however, it would be necessary to have all
food weighed so as to be sure of the correct
proportions; otherwise the actual needs
would not be supplied and the body would
suffer. A wise provision of nature enables
the body to throw off an excess of food
above the body needs without injury, within
limitations; but, as stated, there is no
doubt that the average person exceeds
these limits, exhausting the digestive organs
and loading the system with more
than it can eliminate; the capacity for
mental work is restricted, and the whole
system suffers.</p>

<p>Prof. Chittenden’s experiments have
been a wonderful revelation to dietitians
and scientists. They have demonstrated
beyond doubt that the average person eats
much more than the system requires and
thus overworks the digestive organs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Mixed Diet
versus a
Vegetable
Diet</div>

<p>From the fact that only from two
to four ounces of nitrogenous
food is required to rebuild daily
tissue waste, it is apparent that
this amount can readily be supplied from
the vegetable kingdom, since nuts, legumes,
and cereals are rich in proteins; yet there
is a question whether a purely vegetable
diet is productive of the highest physical
and mental development. Natives of tropical
climates live upon vegetables, fruits,
and nuts, and it may be purely accidental
or be due to climatic or other conditions,
that these nations have not been those who
have made the greatest progress in the
world. Neither have the Eskimos, who live
almost entirely upon meat, attained the
highest development. The greatest progress
and development, both as nations and
as individuals, have been made by inhabitants
of temperate climates, who have lived
upon a mixed diet of meat, eggs, milk,
grains, vegetables, fruits, and nuts. They
have shown more creative force, which
means reserve strength.</p>

<p>The Eskimo has demonstrated, however,
that an entire meat diet supplies all physical
needs; the meat tissue providing growth
and repair and the fat supplying all of the
carbonaceous elements. The fat, as previously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
stated, yields more heat than
starches and sugars, and Nature provides
this heat for climates where most warmth
is required. It may be the natural reason
why natives of warm climates have formed
the habit of using vegetables and grains
for their heat and energy rather than meat.
It is also a natural reason why man, in
temperate climates, eats more meat in
winter than in summer.</p>

<p>An unperverted, natural instinct will always
be found to have a sound physiological
basis. For example,—if, by reason of
some digestive disturbance, one has become
emaciated, all of the fat having been
consumed, and the cause of the disturbance
is removed by an operation or otherwise,
one is seized with an almost insatiable desire
for fat, often eating large chunks of
the fat of meat or large quantities of butter
or cream at a meal. When obstructions
are removed, Nature makes immediate effort
to adjust her forces.</p>

<p>Those who object to eating meat should
study carefully and know that the proper
proportion of protein is supplied with each
day’s rations. The legumes—peas, beans,
nuts, and grains—must be supplied with
the vegetables. While the wheat kernel
contains twelve per cent of protein, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
white flour does not contain as large a percentage
and it will be noted by reference
to Tables II and III, that the majority of
fruits and vegetables contain little nitrogenous
substance.</p>

<p>Unless the whole of the grain and the
legumes form a goodly proportion of the
diet the danger is in consuming too large
a bulk of waste and too much starch in a
purely vegetable diet. In a vegetarian diet,
one is liable to eat too freely of cereals;
as a result, the liver becomes clogged and
torpid and the stomach and intestines are
deranged and rendered incapable of full
digestion and absorption. The clogged
system refuses to assimilate more food.</p>

<p>It follows, therefore, that, unless one is
a thorough student of dietetics, the mixed
diet is by far the safest to follow. One
can better run short of starch or fat in one
day’s rations than to be short of protein,
because if the two to four ounces daily
requirement is not provided the tissues
are consumed and the blood is impoverished.
It is a rare condition in which a
reserve of glycogen and fat is not stored
in the system. On the other hand an excess
of nitrogenous foods calls for a very
active circulation and plenty of oxygen in
the system.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span></p>

<p>It has been held that the vegetarian has
a clearer brain, and, if this be true, it may
be due to the fact that he is not eating too
much and thus his system is not overloaded.</p>

<p>Experience, however, does not prove that
he has greater mental, physical, and moral
power and efficiency. One’s brain, in fasting,
is at first clear and forceful, but the
reason is unbalanced if the fast be too prolonged.</p>

<p><em>A complete diet may be selected without
animal flesh, but including animal products
of eggs, milk, cream, and butter, together
with vegetables, fruits, cereals, and nuts,
yet if the vegetable diet be selected the
legumes, the whole of the grains, and nuts
must be given their share in each day’s rations.</em></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="MENUS">MENUS</h2>
</div>


<p><em>Before giving any menus, let me first of
all impress upon the reader the importance
of eating slowly, of good cheer, of light
conversation during a meal, and of thoroughly
masticating the food. Remember it
is the food</em> <span class="allsmcap">ASSIMILATED</span>, <em>which nourishes</em>.</p>

<p>The following menus allow sufficient
food for average conditions, when the vital
organs are normal.</p>

<p>Fruit, as previously stated, contains a
very small quantity of nutrition. It is more
valuable for its diuretic effect; and to
stimulate the appetite; for this reason it
may well be eaten before a meal.</p>

<p>The citrous fruits tend to neutralize too
strong acids of the blood, increasing its
alkalinity. For this reason, also, they are
best before a meal, particularly before
breakfast; they have a more laxative and
cleansing effect if eaten before the other
food. The custom has been, however, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
eat fruits after dinner for dessert and they
are so given on the following menus.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Sedentary
Occupation</div>

<p>The following diet is for one who
has attained full growth and who
walks a few blocks a day. The
diet may seem light, but where one is sitting
indoor most of the time, and has little
outdoor exercise, less waste protein is oxidized
and less starch, fat and sugar are
required for heat and energy. If too much
carbonaceous food is consumed, one will
store up too much and become too large.
If more protein is consumed than is oxidized
and eliminated one is liable to neuralgic
or rheumatic difficulties.</p>

<p>Every person at sedentary employment
should, without fail, exercise each day as
suggested on pages 104 to 107.</p>

<p>In nearly all of the following menus coffee
and tea have been omitted because, as
before stated, they are not foods, but <em>stimulants</em>
and the caffein and thein may overstimulate
the nerves and the heart. They
retard digestion. Some other warm drink
should be substituted where there is digestive
disturbance, or where the digestion
is weak. They should never at any
time be used strong. They are used for
their pleasing flavor and where one has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
difficulty in governing the desire for them,
sufficient may be used to flavor the water.</p>

<p>The following is a suggestive diet for
one who is not active:</p>


<p class="center no-indent">BREAKFAST</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="fs80" style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">Fruit,</p>

<p class="fs80" style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">Dry toast (two slices), or two muffins or two
gems.</p>
</div>

<p>If one has taken brisk exercise, as suggested
above, or is to take a brisk walk of
a mile or two, a dish of oatmeal or some
other cereal with cream and sugar, may be
added.</p>


<p class="center no-indent">LUNCH</p>

with fruit.</p>

<p class="fs80" style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">Cup of custard or one piece of cake and milk or two
cookies.</p>

<p class="fs80" style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">A glass of milk or buttermilk.</p>

<p class="fs80" style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">If pureé of peas or beans is used the sandwich may
be omitted and one slice of bread is sufficient.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="fs80" style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">Meat, gravy, potatoes or rice.</p>

<p class="fs80" style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">One vegetable, green peas, green beans, cauliflower,
greens, corn. (Do not use dried baked beans or
dried peas with lean meat.)</p>

<p class="fs80" style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">Salad or fruit.</p>

<p class="fs80" style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">Pudding, easily digested, such as bread, rice, tapioca,
cornstarch or chocolate.</p>
</div>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">The Young
Child</div>

<p>After one year, the child should be
given solid food <em>very gradually</em> to
develop his digestive functions as
well as his teeth. The ferment, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
enables him to digest starches is beginning
to form, and he needs some cereal.
A piece of dry toast or a dry cracker will
do. The year old child may also begin to
drink cow’s milk. One or two glasses a
day may be given, until the child is at least
thirteen or fourteen years old.</p>

<p>The child must build muscle, bone and
sinew and more protein is required as soon
as he begins to walk. Milk, eggs and cereals
will furnish this. The heavier protein
diet is best given at eighteen months to
two years, in eggs, cooked soft. These soft
cooked eggs are best when mixed with
broken, dry toast or broken crackers, because
if dry food is served with them, they
will be better masticated, hence more saliva
be mixed with them. The habit of
thorough mastication should be cultivated
at this period.</p>

<p>Oatmeal, thoroughly cooked, and shredded
wheat, with cream and sugar, ripe
fruit, bread and butter, milk, soft cooked
eggs (poached, baked or boiled) constitute
a rational diet.</p>

<p>If the child is hungry between meals, he
should be fed at a regular period, midway
between breakfast and luncheon and between
luncheon and the evening meal. The
food should be dry (toast or a dry cracker)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
to require thorough and slow mastication.</p>

<p>Many object to “piecing” between
meals, but if this piecing be done at hours
as regular as his meal hour, and the food
be dry and well masticated, it will readily
digest and will not interfere with his meals.
The growing child needs more frequent
meals than the adult. His stomach is not
so large, he is active in out door exercise,
and eliminates waste freely. He also requires
much heat and energy. The active
child at outdoor play uses almost as much
energy as the laboring man.</p>

<p>The growing child craves sweets.</p>

<p>Candy should not be taken at any time
during the day, because the digestive system
needs rest. It is quickly converted
into heat and is best eaten immediately following
a meal. Sugar may be spread upon
bread for the four o’clock lunch or a little
candy may be eaten at this time. Two to
three pieces of candy an inch square are
sufficient.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">The Developing,
or the Adolescent
Period</div>

<p>This period begins with a girl,
usually near the thirteenth
year, and with a boy about
fourteen. There is no time in
life when a mother needs to be so watchful
of the diet. Growth is very rapid and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
much easily digested protein is needed to
build tissue, particularly to build the tissue
of red corpuscles.</p>

<p>The red meats, eggs, spinach and all
kinds of greens are important articles of
diet at this time, because of the iron which
they contain. They should be supplied
freely, particularly for developing girls,
or they may otherwise be inclined to
anaemia, at this time. Butter and milk
are valuable and <em>regular exercises with
deep breathing are imperative</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span></p>

<p>A growing child is usually hungry upon
returning from school, and it is well to
take a little easily digested food regularly
but not sufficient to destroy the appetite
for the evening meal. An egg lemonade
is easily digested and satisfying. If active
and exercising freely, craving for sweets
should be gratified, to a limited extent.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">The
Athlete</div>

<p>The young man, active in athletics,
needs the same food as given for the
adolescent, yet more in quantity.
He needs to drink water before his training
and at rest periods during the game.
If he is too fat, he should train off the
superfluous amount by exercise and by
judiciously abstaining from much sugars,
starches and fats. Diets for reductions
must be governed by the condition of the
kidneys and the digestive organs.</p>

<p>Deep breathing habits are imperative
and he must be careful not to overtax lungs
or heart.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">The Laboring
Man</div>

<p>The man engaged in muscular work
requires plenty of food; he can digest
foods which the professional
or business man, or the man of sedentary
habits, cannot. He will probably be able
to drink coffee and tea without any disturbance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
to nerves or to digestion. In his
muscular work he liberates the waste
freely and needs fats, starches and sugars
to supply the heat and energy. This is
especially true of men who work in the
fresh air; the muscular action liberates
waste and heat and the full breathing
freely oxidizes the waste, putting it in condition
to be excreted through lungs, skin,
kidneys and intestines.</p>

<p>He should have more meat, eggs and
nitrogenous foods, and he also needs more
carbonaceous foods to supply heat and energy.
Three hearty meals a day are necessary.</p>

<p>His muscular movements of the trunk
keeps the circulation forceful and the vital
organs strong so that his diet may be almost
as heavy as that of the football
player. Meat or eggs, two or even three
times a day, with tea or coffee, and even
<em>pie</em> may be eaten with impunity. He needs
a good nourishing breakfast of bacon and
eggs or meat, also potatoes, or a liberal
allowance of bread and butter, corn bread,
muffins, etc.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">The Aged</div>

<p>The term aged is not governed entirely
by years. If one stops physical
and mental activity, the vital forces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
recede, muscles and vital organs become
weak and inactive, the waste of the system
is not fully relieved and such a man at
fifty-five is physically and mentally older
than the man who is in active business or
is taking daily vigorous exercise, at seventy
or eighty. The latter may follow the
same diet which he follows at fifty, while
the former should follow the diet of the old
man who has stopped active work. It

<h2 class="nobreak" id="MENUS_FOR_ABNORMAL">MENUS FOR ABNORMAL
CONDITIONS.</h2>
</div>


<p>Where the body is not in normal condition,
because elements are lacking in the
blood, these elements must be supplied in
larger proportions with the food, and the
case is one for a food chemist, or for one
who has made food conditions a study.
When medical colleges broaden their curriculum,
or physicians employ methods
other than medicine and the knife, for correction
of physical ailments, the relief will
be with this profession. If they do not,
professional schools for the education of
the physical culturist and food specialists,
for the correction of deranged conditions
of the system, due to poor circulation
and abnormal blood conditions, which have
so long been controlled entirely through
medicine, will spring up and replace much
of the correction previously left entirely
to the medical fraternity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span></p>

<p>In case of an abnormal condition, the
food must be regulated according to the
case. This also applies to a diet where one
carries an abnormal amount of fat.</p>

<p>In the early stage of various diseases,
where toxins are hoarded in the system, it
is often advisable to abstain from food for
from one to three days, according to conditions.
As previously stated, where the
system is not properly eliminating the
waste, it is wise to abstain from food, to
take brisk exercise, breathe deeply and
drink freely of water, until the waste is
eliminated. A laxative is also desirable.</p>

<p>The above suggestions are for abnormal
conditions. To <em>keep</em> the body in health,
eat at regular periods.</p>

<p>It is the purpose here to give diets for
chronic cases, which the average person
attempts to regulate without a physician
in regular attendance.</p>

<p>The foundation education in regard to
foods, belongs in the public schools. How
many lives are lost on account of the lack
of knowledge of food values will never be
known.</p>

<p>The system readily excretes an excess of
vegetable products, and, as a rule, no acute
difficulties result; however, such chronic
difficulties, as Constipation, Torpid Liver<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
and Indigestion, frequently result from an
excess of starch, over that consumed in
energy. On account of the readiness to
putrefaction of protein products, care
should be taken not to consume these in too
great proportion.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, a diet largely of protein,
which is digested in the stomach, rests
the intestines, and a diet largely of carbohydrates,
rests the stomach, because the
gastric juice is not active in starch digestion.
In case sufficient saliva is not swallowed
with the food to digest the starches
and sugars in the stomach they are passed
into the intestines for digestion. In the
absence of sufficient saliva, water with the
food is desirable to dissolve the starches,
that they may more readily pass the
pylorus.</p>

<p>A study of the habitual taste for foods,
in connection with the physical ailments of
eighteen thousand women, shows that by
the constituents in the blood, and the condition
of the different organs of the digestive
system, one can usually determine
which food the individual has formed a
habit of eating, because the blood will show
a lack of the elements which that patient
has denied himself on account of his likes
and dislikes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span></p>

<p>It is necessary to change the mental attitude
toward certain foods before the system
will assimilate them; thus <em>a taste for
the foods which the body requires should
be cultivated</em>.</p>

<p>Every mother, with growing children,
should be a thorough student of the chemistry
of food. If the child’s bones do not
grow to sufficient size and strength, care in
the selection of foods, rich in proteins,
lime, magnesium and phosphates, may
correct it. Such a child should have meat,
whole wheat bread and eggs.</p>

<p>Where the child stores up too much fat,
care in the amount of exercise, and of oxygen
consumed, as well as the regulation of
diet, are of vital importance. If one is thin
and undernourished, chemical analysis of
the contents of stomach, intestines and kidneys
should be made, the nerves be rested
and proper food, exercise and breathing
should accompany medical treatment, if
medicine is needed.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Anaemia</div>

<p>Regular exercise and deep breathing
are fully as important as the
regulation of diet for the anaemic. In
anaemia the red blood corpuscles are lacking,
or there is not sufficient blood. The
red corpuscles not being sufficient in number<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
to carry the necessary quantity of oxygen
to the tissues to oxidize the waste, the
system becomes clogged with waste, which
affects the nerves and brain cells. The
patient is tired and disinclined to exercise,
thus the decreased number of red corpuscles
are not kept in forceful circulation and
the carbonic acid gas is not freely thrown
off by the lungs; this further aggravates
the condition.</p>

<p>Pus formation, in abscesses, are frequent
in anaemic cases.</p>

<p>There is little desire for food when the
system is clogged, and there is little use in
forcing food.</p>

<p>The red corpuscles are made in the red
marrow of the bones and free action of
the joints is desirable.</p>

<p>The initial work, therefore in the correction
of anaemia, lies in brisk, every day
exercise and deep breathing of fresh air.
Such exercise should be intelligently directed
to the joints and to the vital organs,
particularly to the liver, that it may be
kept in normal condition to break down the
protein waste. The windows at night
should admit of a good circulation of air
through the sleeping room. These habits
being established, the diet should consist
of foods containing iron, such as red meat,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
eggs and the green leaves of vegetables.
Milk sipped slowly and a free use of butter
are desirable.</p>

<p>It will usually be found that the anaemic
individual has no taste for vegetables containing
iron, or for meats rich in albuminoids,—or,
that these foods have been
denied because of their scarcity; therefore,
the elements necessary for red blood corpuscles
have been deficient.</p>

<p>The following is a suggestive diet:</p>

<p class="center no-indent">BREAKFAST</p>

<p class="fs80" style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span></p>

<p>If the patient still has no appetite, more
exercise, deep breathing and abstinence
from all food for a day or two are desirable.
This will give the system a chance
to clear itself of waste and when the waste
is relieved through exercise and diet the
desire for food will assert itself.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Indigestion
and
Dyspepsia</div>

<p>Indigestion or Dyspepsia is the
broad term commonly applied to
most chronic stomach and intestinal
difficulties—due, not to structural
disease, but to their being incapable
of normally performing their functions in
digesting ordinary foods. The term includes
troubles arising from so many different
causes that the cause must be determined
and remedied before definite results
can be attained through diet.</p>

<p>Most chronic cases are due to improper
hygiene,—such as irregular meals; over
eating; insufficient mastication; wrong
choice of foods; or to a general run down
condition, with a weakness of muscles of
the stomach, due to insufficient blood supply;
or to a weakened or over-strenuous
condition of nerves controlling the stomach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span></p>

<p>Indigestion is usually accompanied by
constipation, or by irregular action of the
intestines.</p>

<p>Plenty of fresh air, and exercise, directed
definitely to muscles and nerves of
the stomach, that it may be strengthened
by a better blood supply, as well as exercises
and deep breathing to build up the
general health, should be systematically
followed.</p>

<p>Easily digested food, well masticated,
and regular meals served daintily, with
following of above directions, will gradually
regulate digestion.</p>

<p>Without doubt, the intelligent medical
treatment of stomach difficulties in the
future will be directed by a chemical analysis
of the stomach contents. If the stomach
is not secreting normal proportions of
pepsin or hydrochloric acid, the deficiency
can be regulated. The chemical analysis
of the gastric secretions will alone determine
what elements are lacking. As stated
above, the permanent relief must lie in
gaining a good circulation of blood through
the entire body and through the stomach,
that it may be strengthened and thus enabled
to secrete these elements in proper
proportions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span></p>

<p>Many cases of stomach difficulty are due
to the condition of the nerves.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Nervous Indigestion</b> is due to the general
nerve condition. In such cases the
entire nervous system should be regulated
through exercise, breathing, relaxation and
a change of thought. Physicians usually
recommend change of scene to direct
change of thought.</p>

<p>The diet should be light and laxative
and low in protein. Cream soup, bread
and milk, crackers and milk, custards, egg
lemonade, and gruels, furnish an easily digested
list. No tea, coffee, very little meat
and no fried food. Where the walls of the
stomach are weak and distended, light food
six times a day is preferable to a hearty
meal, which distends the stomach walls.</p>

<p>Where a loss of weight occurs, it usually
indicates a failure to <em>assimilate</em> a sufficient
amount of food, rather than a failure to
eat sufficient. A good circulation, particularly
through the vital organs, deep
full breathing of fresh air, and regular
and complete rest periods, should be
observed. Usually a dietitian, or a physician,
is not called in chronic cases until the
condition has prevailed for so long that
other complications have set in and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
patient has lost much flesh. It takes
months to pull the system down and it
takes months of following of proper hygiene
to build it up.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Gastritis or Catarrh of the Stomach</b> involving
an inflammation of the mucous lining
of the stomach, is a most common phase
of indigestion. In acute cases the physician
is called at once. He can treat
the case in its initial stages and bring about
a much more rapid recovery.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Acute Gastritis</b> is accompanied by nausea
and vomiting and the patient should
rest from all food and drink for two days.
If the mouth is dry, water or ice may be
given frequently and held in the mouth,
but not swallowed.</p>

<p>After two days rest, begin the nourishment
with water and a small portion of
liquid food (not over two ounces) every
two hours. Toast tea, made by pouring
hot water over toast, oatmeal, or barley
gruel (thoroughly strained so that no
coarse matter may irritate the stomach),
limewater and milk, and egg lemonade are
easily digested foods to begin to eat. Increase
the quantity the fourth day and
lengthen the time between feedings to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
three hours. Gradually increase the diet
by semi-liquid food, soft boiled eggs,
moistened toast, raw oysters, etc., slowly
returning to the regular bill of fare.</p>

<p>Avoid, as you do so, any food difficult
of digestion and any vegetable containing
coarse fibre. Tea, coffee, pickles, and alcoholic
drinks should be avoided.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Chronic Gastritis</b> is accompanied with
a thickening of the mucous lining of the
stomach. It is usually caused by prolonged
use of irritating foods and the regulation
of the diet is of utmost importance.
Alcohol is a common cause. The difficulty
begins gradually and the relief must likewise
be gradual.</p>

<p>The stomach needs water. If the drinking
of water causes nausea it is well to
wash it out with a stomach pump each
morning before breakfast.</p>

<p>If not convenient to use the stomach
pump the washing may be accomplished by
drinking two glasses of water at least an
hour before breakfast, followed by stomach
exercises, to cause a regurgitation of the
water through the stomach. This will be
uncomfortable at first, with a very full feeling
and one may begin by drinking one
glass, followed by stomach exercises, gradually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
taking another glass within a half
hour of the first. This, with the exercises,
will wash out the mucus. In many cases as
much as a pint of slimy mucus collects in
the stomach during the night. Where the
stomach cleansing is impossible, in above
manner, the stomach tube should be used.</p>

<p>Chronic gastritis, in any of its phases, is
frequently accompanied by constipation,
and the diet should be so selected as to be
as laxative as possible, without irritating
the lining of the stomach. The liquid diet
assists the intestines, to a certain extent,
particularly if the stomach be cleansed by
the water in the morning, as indicated
under Mucous Gastritis below.</p>

<p>Fruit in the morning and just before retiring
aid the intestines. Two prunes
chopped up with one fig or a bunch of
grapes or an apple just before retiring assist
the action of the intestines and the
kidneys.</p>

<p>Almost all fruits contain acid, which increases
peristalsis, and the resultant flow
of gastric juice. Cooked pears, stewed or
baked apples, prunes and dates are mild
fruits which may be used if they agree with
the patient. The juice of an orange upon
first arising may be used, except in case<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
of a diminution, or absence, of hydrochloric
acid.</p>

<p>Peptonized milk is an excellent food
both for chronic and acute cases especially
in severe cases. This is prepared by putting
“pancreatin,” a pancreatic ferment,
(trypsin), into fresh milk. Preparations
of “pancreatin” are sold in the drug
stores. The peptonized milk does not form
curds and readily passes through the
stomach for digestion in the intestine.
This may be given for a few days, followed
by milk and limewater, barley and toast
water, kumyss, oatmeal gruel, meat juices,
scraped meat (raw, boiled or roasted),
broths thickened with thoroughly cooked
cereals, ice cream, egg lemonade, gelatins
and whipped cream, custards, raw oysters.</p>

<p>After one week gradually assume the
regular diet of easily digested foods. All
cereals should be thoroughly cooked. The
white meat of chicken is readily digested.
As the solid food diet is assumed, regularity
of food, in small amounts, and
thorough mastication are important. If
the patient imagines he is chewing it will
help him to keep chewing until the food
is reduced to a pulp.</p>

<p>Avoid meat with tough fibre, too fat
meat (pork), sausage, lobster, salmon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
chicken salads, mayonnaise, cucumbers,
pickles, cabbage, tea, coffee and alcohol.</p>

<p>Four or five light meals a day are preferable
to three heavy meals.</p>

<p><em>The regulation of the flow of gastric
juices</em> is constitutional. The general circulation
must be forceful, the habit of deep
breathing and of regular periods of complete
rest of body and mind established.</p>

<p>Since one with chronic gastritis is liable
to have many idiosyncracies, he should not
be urged to eat foods for which he has a
dislike. The easily digested foods should
be prepared in various ways and served
in an appetizing, dainty manner.</p>

<p>There are four special phases of chronic
gastritis, Mucous Gastritis, Hyperchlorhydria,
Hypochlorhydria and Achlorhydria.</p>

<p>In <em>Mucous Gastritis</em> there is a profuse
secretion of mucus into the stomach. In
this case it is always well to wash out the
stomach before introducing food, as suggested
above.</p>

<p>The same general diet, suggested above
for acute gastritis, should be followed.</p>

<p><em>Hyperchlorhydria.</em> The condition known
as Hyperchlorhydria shows a liberal excess
of hydrochloric acid. The condition
is common, and is brought on by worry,
nervous excitement, eating when overtired,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
irregularity of food, imperfect mastication
and excessive use of alcohol. The diet
should be a mixed one, in about normal proportions.
If anything, it should incline
more to proteins than to starches. The
hydrochloric acid is necessary for the digestion
of proteins. It reduces the protein
to acid albumin, which is less irritating to
the stomach. However the proteins are
stimulating to the stomach and the protein
proportion should not be carried to excess.</p>

<p>The juice of one-fourth of a lemon taken
one half hour before the meal will decrease
the secretion of hydrochloric acid into the
stomach.</p>

<p>Limewater and milk may constitute the
diet for two days; alkaline, effervescing
mineral water may be used and then the
diet should follow the general principles
for chronic gastritis. Avoid all irritating
foods.</p>

<p><em>Hypochlorhydria</em> is a diminution in the
amount of hydrochloric acid. Physicians
often administer hydrochloric acid about
one half hour to an hour after the meal.</p>

<p>Many advocate a diet omitting protein,
but since protein foods stimulate the flow
of gastric juices, they should <em>not</em> be omitted,
but used a little less freely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span></p>

<p><em>Achlorhydria.</em> Where there is an entire
absence of hydrochloric acid, as in Achlorhydria,
the stomach, of course, cannot
digest proteins and this digestion must be
done entirely by the trypsin of the pancreatic
juice. The presence of liquified
protein as beef juice in the stomach, however,
acts as a stimulus to the gastric juice
and is an agency in again starting its flow.</p>

<p>The foods should be liquid, so as to pass
through the stomach without irritation.
Clear milk must be excluded, because of
the action of the rennin in coagulating the
casein. This would irritate the stomach.</p>

<p>Peptonized milk, described on page <a href="#Page_245">245</a>
may be used as an article of diet,—also
milk with limewater, gelatin, cream, olive
oil, gruels, and any foods which would pass
through the stomach in a liquid state. Any
cereals must exclude the bran and must be
masticated to a pulp, so that they may
readily pass into the small intestine.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Dilation of the Stomach</b> results from continued
overeating, (especially when the
nerves are weak), or eating when over
tired. The muscular walls become so weak
that they fail to contract. Peristalsis is
likewise weak and the food, failing to digest
promptly, ferments and forms gas. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
dilated stomach is larger and its weight
and weakness cause it to prolapse.</p>

<p>In the prolapsed condition the pyloric,
or lower orifice of the stomach, is often
nearly closed, partly by reason of its position
and partly by the weakened folds of
the stomach walls. Because of this obstruction
to the free emptying of the contents
into the duodenum, it is imperative
that the food be masticated to a pulp and
thus mixed with saliva, that the salivary
digestion of starches may be complete in
the stomach; or, at least, that all foods be
reduced to a liquid state in the stomach. A
chunk of food could not easily pass through
the pylorus. All liquid or semi-liquid food
should be held in the mouth until it, also, is
mixed with saliva. The stomach should
not be overloaded with either food or water
and for this reason six meals a day, of light
feeding, is best.</p>

<p>A dilated stomach does not necessarily
indicate that the digestive juices are not
secreted in normal proportions and easily
digested proteins need not be avoided. It
is desirable to furnish the proteins in concentrated
form, as in meats, so as to get
the most nutrition with the least bulk.
Milk may be used, with limewater, if sipped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
slowly and held in the mouth until mixed
with saliva.</p>

<p>Sugar should be used very sparingly,
because it ferments readily and aggravates
the distension. If it is evident that
fermented products are in the stomach, it
should be washed out with a stomach
pump.</p>

<p>A tumor near the pylorus, or constriction
of the pyloric orifice, will also cause
dilation of the stomach.</p>

<p>Beef juice, any of the better grades of
meats, well masticated and containing no
gristle, limewater and milk, soft cooked
eggs, and well cooked cereals should constitute
the diet.</p>

<p>Avoid vegetables containing coarse fibre,
fried foods, and bread baked on the same
day.</p>

<p>Liquid with the meal should be avoided,
on account of the tendency to overload
the stomach.</p>

<p>Cold water, taken a swallow at a time
at intervals during the day, has a tonic
effect upon the relaxed muscles. It also
incites the flow of gastric juice.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Ulcer of the Stomach.</b> Where this condition
is severe, accompanied with severe
pains and vomiting of blood, the dietetic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
treatment is to give the nourishment
through the rectum for from five to ten
days. Then follows a period of ten days
milk diet, with bouillon, barley water, a
beaten egg, and once a day, after the third
day, strained oatmeal gruel.</p>

<p>Limewater is added to the milk to avoid
the formation of leathery curds and to neutralize
the acids of the stomach. The
patient is given half a cup of milk every
hour for three days, from 7 A. M. to 9 P. M.
From the third to the tenth day increase
the quantity to one cupful, then to a cup
and a half and lengthen the periods between
feedings to two hours. If the milk
is brought to a boil before the limewater
is added, it digests more readily.</p>

<p>After ten days, for the succeeding ten
days the nourishment should be given
every two hours and the diet varied by
semi-liquid foods, such as gruels, toast
water, soft boiled egg (once a day) beef
juice, two softened crackers (once a day)
gelatin, buttermilk and strained soups.</p>

<p>After twenty days the patient, if all is
well, may very gradually resume a normal
diet, beginning with baked potatoes,
softened toast, lamb chops, a small piece
of steak or white meat of chicken. It is
imperative that all food, liquid or solid,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
be thoroughly mixed with saliva and that
solids be chewed to a pulp.</p>

<p>Liquids must not be swallowed either
hot or cold, but about body temperature.
Cold water may be taken into the mouth
when more palatable than warm and held
there until about body temperature before
it is swallowed. All liquid should be
sipped, not swallowed in gulps.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Cancer of the Stomach.</b> Since the
growth most often obstructs the pylorus,
the stomach is usually dilated and the
general directions for dilation of the
stomach should be followed. If the food
will not digest in the stomach, one must
resort to rectal feeding. Where gastric
digestion is near normal, the general principles
of diet for ulceration of the stomach
should be followed.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Intestinal
Disorders</div>

<p>Most cases of intestinal difficulties
may traced to a clogged condition,
either due to a weakness of the
nerves and of the intestinal muscles, and
a resultant weak peristalsis, which does
not strongly move the mass along its
course, or to a failure of the liver to discharge
sufficient bile to lubricate the mass.
If the waste is not promptly moved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
through the intestines, irritation may result
and the poisons from bacterial fermentations
will be absorbed by the system.</p>

<p>Deranged stomach digestion also interferes
with the digestion in the intestines.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Constipation.</b> The causes of this difficulty
are so varied that it can seldom
be regulated by diet alone. It can be
<em>helped</em>. A large number of cases of chronic
constipation are due to the failure to respond
to Nature’s call at a regular time
each day, thus establishing a regular habit
at a certain hour. Many others are due to
the weakness of the muscular walls of the
intestines or to the nerves controlling
them. In this event the intestinal peristalsis
is weak. Still another cause is a
failure of the liver to discharge sufficient
bile into the intestines to lubricate the
foeces. Many chronic cases are due to the
pill and drug habit. Where one continues
to take pills, the condition brings a result
similar to the feeding of “predigested”
food,—if the work is done for the organs
they become lazy and rely upon artificial
aid. <em>Every part of the body requires
activity for strength.</em></p>

<p>If the straight front corset cramps the
intestines it may cause constipation by restraining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
their normal exercise during
movements of the body in walking, etc.
Every woman who wears the straight
front corset should take exercises for the
intestines morning and night.</p>

<p>The most natural relief for constipation
is exercise,—particularly exercise directed
to the muscles of the intestines and to the
nerve centers controlling them.</p>

<p>Such foods as are laxative in effect, with
the free use of water are helpful. Figs
and raisins (due to their seeds), prunes,
dates, grapes, apples, and rhubarb are
laxative, due to their acids. These have
best effect when eaten just before retiring.</p>

<p>Oatmeal, or any cereal containing the
bran, is laxative,—such as bran bread or
green corn.</p>

<p>As must be inferred from the above
statement, the <em>cause</em> of the difficulty must
first be reached.</p>

<p>Children should be trained to attend to
Nature’s call regularly <em>every</em> day. The
best time is shortly after breakfast.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Enteritis.</b> (<b>Inflammation or Catarrh of
the Intestines</b>) is similar in its nature to
Gastritis or Catarrh of the Stomach and
is treated in a similar manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span></p>

<p><em>Acute Enteritis</em>, as Acute Gastritis, is
usually caused by a strong irritant,—either
by some food which disagrees, or by a mass
of undigested food. A fast of two or three
days is the initial dietetic treatment. A
free drinking of water not only soothes the
irritated intestines but it cleanses the intestinal
tract and assists the kidneys in
eliminating elements of fermentation; if
these are not eliminated, they will absorb
into the blood.</p>

<p>Physicians usually give a course of calomel
and castor oil to eliminate all intestinal
contents.</p>

<p>After the fast, a liquid and semi-liquid
diet is followed until inflammation is relieved.
Milk, strained gruels, broths,
strained soups, buttermilk, eggs (soft
cooked or raw), beef juice, barley water,
custards, gelatines, soft puddings, etc., are
the foods most nourishing and causing
least irritation.</p>

<p>All irritating foods as coarse vegetables,
pickles, acid fruits and fruits with coarse
seeds, candies, beer, wines and salads
should be omitted.</p>

<p><em>Chronic Enteritis</em> has the same general
cause as Acute Enteritis, though its onset
is slow and it takes a correspondingly
longer time to correct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Dysentery</b>, if acute, demands complete
rest in bed. The diet in both Acute
and Chronic cases must be confined to easily
digested foods, such as peptonized
milk (see page <a href="#Page_244">244</a>), boiled milk, pressed
meat juice, and the white of egg, beaten
and served with milk. Blackberry brandy,
and tea made from wild cherry bark, tend
to check the inflammation.</p>

<p>During convalescence, care must be
taken not to over-feed. Begin a more liberal
diet with a more liberal allowance of
beef juice, gradually adding tender beef
steak, roast beef, fish, white meat of
chicken, eggs, custards, wine jelly, dry
toast, blancmange, well boiled rice and
other easily digested food. The beef and
egg are particularly valuable, because of
the anaemia occasioned by the loss of
blood.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Rectal
Feeding</div>

<p>is sometimes necessary in cases of
ulcer, cancer, or tumor, along the digestive
tract. Since food is not absorbed
in the large as readily as in the
small intestine, the strength cannot be
fully maintained through rectal feeding.
In cases where the stomach is not able to
digest the food, it is the best expedient,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
however, until the functioning of the stomach
is re-established.</p>

<p>The rectum should be prepared about
an hour before the feeding by a full injection
of water, to thoroughly cleanse the
intestine. Place the patient on his side
with the hips elevated. If for any reason
he cannot lie on his side, let him lie on his
back and elevate the foot of his bed. After
the water cleansing, inject two or three
ounces of water in which a small pinch of
salt (6%) has been added and let it go
high up into the rectum.</p>

<p>Two to three ounces four to five hours
apart is the desirable quantity of rectal
nutrition for an adult. The white of egg,
beef juice, and milk, all peptonized, are
the best foods. The pancreatic trypsin,
sold in preparations of “pancreatin” is
best. Unless milk is peptonized the casein
will be difficult to absorb. The food should
always be salted, as salt aids the absorption.</p>

<p>The white of egg should be diluted with
four or five times its volume of water; to
beef juice add an equal volume of water.
The yolk of egg contains too much oil to
absorb readily. Fats are not absorbed
through the rectum. If egg and beef juice
are used without milk, a little sugar may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
be added. Milk contains sugar in proportion.</p>

<p>It is not advisable to inject wine as it
interferes with absorption of other foods.</p>

<p>The nutriment should be forced eight to
ten inches up into the rectum to insure absorption.
This can be done by using a
small injection point on a rubber tube and
gently and patiently turning it as it is
inserted. The tube may be oiled to prevent
irritation.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Derangements
of
the Liver</div>

<p>The liver is not, in a strict sense.
a digestive organ, but it is very
dependent upon them, as all products
of digestion must pass
through it and the starches, sugars and
proteins, after they enter the blood, undergo
chemical changes here.</p>

<p>For a fuller understanding of the reasons
for the following suggestions regarding
diet for the liver, the writer would request
a re-reading, at this point, of the
chapter upon the “Work of the Liver”
upon pages 81 to 92.</p>

<p>It will be recalled that the liver acts,
not only upon proteins, sugars, and
starches,—the nourishing foods, but it also
stands guard over poisonous ferments, due
to putrefactions absorbed from the intestines,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
rendering them harmless; to a limited
extent it also oxidizes the poisons of
alcohol. The fats also pass through the
liver.</p>

<p>Since all products of digestion must pass
through this organ, it is easy to see how it
may be overworked, for it is an undisputed
fact that most people eat more food than
is required to maintain the body in nitrogenous
equilibrium and to supply the necessary
heat and energy.</p>

<p>After the gorging of a heavy meal, the
overloaded blood and liver express themselves
in a sluggish brain and one feels
mentally, as well as physically, logy, or
overloaded.</p>

<p>Since both sugar, carbohydrates and
protein undergo chemical changes in the
liver, it is evident that a diet consisting of
an excess of either, must overwork the
liver, not only through the nutritive food
elements absorbed, but through the toxic
substances which must be absorbed,—due
to the excessive amount of food not being
digested as readily as a smaller amount.
If the food remains in the intestines too
long, it is attacked by the bacteria always
present there, fermentation results and
poisons are absorbed and carried to the
liver, where they must be broken down and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
rendered harmless, so as not to affect other
parts of the system. If for any reason the
liver is diseased, overloaded, or its action
is sluggish, it will not promptly oxidize
these toxins.</p>

<p>One of the most important corrective
agencies for an inactive liver is exercise
directed to this organ, to bring a free supply
of blood, and deep breathing of fresh
air. <em>It is apparent that the blood must
carry its full quota of oxygen to assist in
oxidizing both the nitrogenous waste and
the poisons</em>; and it must be remembered
that the liver must oxidize the waste from
its own tissues, as well as from other parts
of the system.</p>

<p>It is apparent, from the above, that the
regulation of diet for an abnormal liver
must be more in the <em>quantity</em> than in the
<em>quality</em> of food and in the perfect digestion.
It depends also upon the activity of
the intestines, since the poisonous products
of imperfectly digested and fermenting
food, not being regularly eliminated, must
be absorbed and carried to the liver. It is
to free the intestines of the waste containing
the toxins that physicians give calomel
and other strong cathartics, to work off the
toxins. These cathartics also work off
foodstuffs from the intestines before they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
are absorbed, so that the liver has more
rest.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Torpid Liver or Billiousness.</b> This condition
is due to the sluggish action of this
organ and a consequent failure to eliminate
the bile through the bile ducts into the duodenum.
It may be caused by inactivity
and a resultant sluggish circulation of
blood, to overwork of the liver, due to overeating,
to breathing of impure air, or to
insufficient breathing of pure air. It may
also result from constipation and a resultant
absorption of toxic matter as described
above.</p>

<p>Many cases of billiousness are occasioned
by obstruction of the opening of
the bile ducts into the intestines, which is
often occasioned by an excess of mucus
in the duodenum. In such cases exercise
for the intestines is clearly indicated.</p>

<p>In the bending, twisting and squirming
movements which the infant in the cradle
makes, the liver is regularly squeezed and
relaxed. The same is true in the free movements
of an active child at play. If during
adult life these same free movements
of bending and twisting the trunk were
continued daily and correct habits of free
breathing of pure air were established,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
there would be little call for “liver tonics.”</p>

<p>The elaboration of carbohydrates in the
liver is an important part of its work and
in case of inactive liver the sugars and
starches should be limited, allowing that
function to rest. Yet it is a mistake to
allow a diet too rich in protein. The best
method is to cut down the quantity of a
mixed diet.</p>

<p>Two glasses of water an hour before
breakfast followed by brisk exercise for the
vital organs and deep breathing are important.
The daily action of the bowels is
imperative. In extreme cases a fast of two
or three days, with a copious use of water,
is recommended. Following this fast the
diet should consist of easily digested foods,
eliminating those containing starch and
sugars in too great proportions, and it
should be as limited as possible, consistent
with the actual necessity for rebuilding
and for energy.</p>

<p>Some authorities restrict fats in a diet
for billiousness but the presence of fat in
the duodenum stimulates the flow of pancreatic
juice, which in turn stimulates the
secretion of bile.</p>

<p>Lemon stimulates the action of the
hepatic glands and thus tends to increase
the liver activity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span></p>

<p>There is a prevalent thought that eggs
and milk cause sluggish liver action.
There is no physiological reason for this
if too much food is not eaten. One often
loses sight of the fact that milk is a food
as well as a beverage, and that when milk
constitutes an appreciable part of the diet
other foods should be limited accordingly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gall
Stones</div>

<p>The diet for gall stones need have
no reduction in protein nor carbohydrates,
since the oxidation, or the
chemical action upon sugars is not interfered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>with. The presence of fat in the
duodenum increases the flow of pancreatic
juice which, in turn stimulates the flow of
bile, so olive oil is often recommended in
case of gall stones.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Diabetes</div>

<p>is a serious disturbance of nutrition.
It is known and tested by the
appearance of sugar in the urine. However,
the conclusion should not be drawn
that one has diabetes if the urine test for
a day shows sugar. This may be due to
an excess of carbohydrates, particularly of
sugar in the diet a day or two previous
and all trace of it may disappear in a day.
If continued tests for some period show
an excess, nutritional disturbances are indicated.</p>

<p>The most usual form of diabetes is <em>diabetes
mellitus</em>. It is supposed to be due to
a disturbance in the secretions from the
pancreas. Experiments have shown that
the general process of putting the carbohydrates
in condition to be absorbed into
the blood is controlled by a secretion from
the pancreas.</p>

<p>The difficulty which confronts the dietitian
is to prescribe a diet without carbohydrates
which will keep up the body
weight and not disturb the nutritive equilibrium.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
The diet must consist of protein
and fat and one danger is in the tendency
to acetic and other acids in the blood, which
involves the nervous system. The patient
has a craving for sugars and starches, but
the system cannot make use of them, and
the heat and energy must be supplied by
fats. While, as a rule, the craving for certain
foods is an indication that the system
needs the elements contained in it,—this
is true in the craving of the diabetes patient
for carbohydrates,—yet the desire <em>must
not</em> be gratified, because of the inability to
digest them.</p>

<p>There is often a distaste for fat, but its
use is imperative and in large quantities,
because the weight and general vitality
must be maintained. The effort of the
physician is to get the system in condition
to use carbohydrates.</p>

<p>Fats may be supplied in the yolk of egg,
cream, butter, cheese, bacon, nuts, particularly
pecans, butternuts, walnuts and Brazil
nuts.</p>

<p>In beginning a diet, the change must not
be too sudden. At least a week’s time
should be allowed for the elimination of
all sugar and starch. Begin by eliminating
sugars and next bread and potatoes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span></p>

<p>Van Noorden gives the following diet,
free from carbohydrates, which has been
in general use in Europe and America.</p>

<p class="fs80" style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">

<br>

<p>Van Noorden includes alcohol, in whisky,
in his diet and most physicians follow the
theory that whisky or brandy aids in the
digestion and absorption of fats; the need
is recognized since fats must be supplied
in so large quantities, yet the sweet wines
and beers contain sugar while the sour
wines contain acids, which disturb digestion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span></p>

<p>There is a grave question in regard to
the advisability of including alcohol in the
diet of a young person afflicted with diabetes
and the greater activity of the young
patient will insure more perfect digestion,
so that the physician may not consider
alcohol necessary.</p>

<p>Dr. Hall gives the following as a reasonable
diet for a diabetic case, after the first
week or two, allowing potatoes.</p>


<p class="center no-indent">BREAKFAST.</p>

<p class="fs80" style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">

<p>After a week on either of the above diets,
in mild cases, sugar will disappear from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
the urine. In extreme cases, it may be
necessary to follow this strict regime for
two weeks. When the patient begins to
eat a little starch, potatoes and bread are
re-instated first. Sugar is kept out of the
diet, except the little in fruit and vegetables,
until the urine shows no trace of it.</p>

<p>The following is a list of foods allowable:</p>

<p>Fresh meat, fish, oysters, clams, lobster,
turtle, meat extracts, fats of all kinds,
eggs, such fresh vegetables as peas, beans,
lentils, lettuce, celery, asparagus, cabbage,
pickles, clear soups (all kinds), cheese (all
kinds), coffee, tea (without sugar), cream,
butter, fruit, acid drinks and carbonated
waters.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Derangements
of the
Kidneys</div>

<p>In the dietetic treatment of any
diseased organ, the object must be
to give that organ as much rest
as consistent with keeping up the
general nutrition of the system. The stomach
and intestines are so closely allied that,
where one is affected, the other is liable to
affection also, and the dietetic treatment
is regulated accordingly. Yet generally
speaking, in stomach disorders the quantity
of protein is limited; in intestinal disorders
the starches, sugar and fats are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
limited. Since the office of the kidneys is
to pass from the system the soluble salts
and the nitrogenous waste, which dissolve
in water, the work of the kidneys in most
conditions is aided by a copious drinking
of water. Since uric acid is stimulated by
the kidneys, the proteins should be restricted
in the diet, particularly those
formed from the glands of animals,—as
liver, sweetbreads, kidneys, also brains.
Potatoes, green vegetables, stone fruits
and cranberries aggravate an acute condition.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Acute Nephritis.</b> In case of inflammation
of the kidneys the excretions are interrupted.
In this event the quantity of
water should be limited to three to four
glasses a day. In the event that the kidneys
will not excrete the water, the pores
of the skin must be kept freely open by
sweat baths to assist in the elimination of
waste.</p>

<p>Dr. Hall recommends a milk and cream
diet of from three to seven pints a day, for
a few days, according to the case,—two
parts of milk to one of cream. If the urine
is scanty, he reduces it to one and one half
pints a day, taken in four or five installments.
After the three to seven days of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
milk diet he gradually introduces starches
and fats.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Brights Disease.</b> This term covers forms
of diseases of the kidneys, associated with
albumin in the urine.</p>

<p>Where for any reason the kidneys have
difficulty in discharging the nitrogenous
waste of the system, the work of the dietitian
must be to eliminate protein from the
diet as closely as may be consistent with
the body necessities. Besides restricting
the amount of nitrogenous foods, the kidneys
must be assisted in eliminating the
nitrogenous waste, and the products of the
inflammation, by a copious drinking of
water. Hot water and hot diluent drinks
are best, such as toast water, barley water,
cream of tartar, lemon and acid drinks.
In acute cases the patient is put on a milk
diet of from two to three pints of milk a
day, given one-half pint every three or four
hours, diluted with one-third as much hot
water. If the case be a prolonged one,
broths may be included.</p>

<p>Even in cases which are chronic and not
acute, it is well to follow a milk diet for a
number of weeks. The quantity of milk,
for an exclusive milk diet, must depend
upon the age and size of the patient as well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
as upon his ability to exercise. If he is
confined to his room, from five to seven
pints of milk a day are sufficient. If he is
taking a great deal of exercise, he may
take from eighteen to twenty glasses of
milk a day. If he loses weight on the milk
diet, bread and rice may be added.</p>

<p>It is unwise to begin a milk diet at once,
by feeding from eighteen to twenty glasses
of milk a day, but this amount may be approximated
within a week’s time and the
change in diet should be begun by cutting
down all meats and legumes and gradually
eliminating starches. In changing from a
milk diet to a diet including more hearty
foods, the transition should be gradual.</p>

<p>A. F. Pattee gives the following diet for
Brights Disease.</p>


<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p><b>DIET: Soup.</b>—Vegetable or fish soup, broths
with rice or barley.</p>

<p><b>Fish.</b>—Raw oysters or clams, fresh fish broiled

<p><b>Meats.</b>—Eat sparingly, chicken, game, fat bacon,
fat ham.</p>

<p><b>Farinaceous.</b>—Stale bread, whole wheat bread,
toast, milk toast, biscuits, macaroni, rice, cereals
of all kinds.</p>

<p><b>Vegetables.</b>—Onion, cauliflower, mashed potatoes,
mushrooms, lettuce, watercress, spinach, celery,
cabbage.</p>

<p><b>Desserts.</b>—Ripe raw fruits, stewed fruits, rice
tapioca, bread and milk puddings, junkets, cocoa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span></p>

<p><b>Liquids.</b>—Toast water, weak tea, pure water,

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Nervous
Disorders</div>

<p>The condition of the nerves depends
upon the general condition of the
system and upon general nutrition.
There is no one food or set of foods which
directly affect any nervous trouble, unless
this trouble be localized by disturbance in
some particular organ. Then the effort
must be to correct the difficulty in that
organ.</p>

<p>There is no disturbance in any part of
the body requiring less medicine than a
disturbance in the nerves. The correction
must come through general hygienic treatment.
Regular exercise, alternated with
regular rest periods, the formation of the
habit of complete nerve relaxation, the
general regulation of an easily digested,
nutritious diet, with deep breathing exercises,
are the best remedies.</p>

<p>In many cases of nerve debility the
nerves seem to be stronger in the latter
part of the day. Where this is the case
the hearty meal should be eaten at this
time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Neurasthenia.</b> In cases of Neurasthenia,
or “Tired Nerves,” all vital organs are
more or less affected, because the nerves
do not properly direct digestion, absorption,
assimilation or elimination and,
for this reason, the diet should be light
and of easily digested foods. <em>A free,
correct breathing of fresh air, day and
night, is imperative.</em> It is important also
to thoroughly masticate all food and drink
freely of water. A change of thought, induced
by a change of scene or companions,
is helpful.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Gout</div>

<p>This difficulty is usually the result of
high living. It most often attacks people
past middle age, who have indulged
in rich pastries, puddings, meat three
times a day, or who have frequently indulged
in alcohol.</p>

<p>Being supposedly caused by an excess
of uric acid and other waste deposited in
the joints, resulting from too much protein
and an insufficient elimination of the
waste of the system, the dietetic treatment
must be a low protein diet. Alcohol is absolutely
prohibited and the quantity of carbohydrates
and fats must be cut down as
well as the protein.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span></p>

<p>In <em>acute cases</em> a diet of bread and milk,
or toast and milk, with light vegetable
broths should be followed for one to three
days.</p>

<p>In <em>chronic cases</em> the diet may consist of
the following:<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p><b>Soups.</b>—Vegetable broths.</p>

<p><b>Fish.</b>—Fresh fish, shell fish, raw oysters.</p>

<p><b>Meats.</b>—It is better to omit all meats. If meat
is eaten at all, it should be confined to game,
chicken and fat bacon.</p>

<p><b>Farinaceous.</b>—Cereals, crackers, dry toast, milk
toast, macaroni, graham or whole wheat bread, rye
bread, oatmeal and any of the breakfast foods.</p>

<p><b>Nuts.</b>—With salt.</p>

<p>Vegetables.—Celery, lettuce, watercress, all
greens, with vinegar, string beans, green peas, potatoes,
carrots and beets.</p>

<p><b>Fruits.</b>—All fruits, stewed or fresh. Unpeeled
apples are especially recommended. (Greens, with
vinegar and unpeeled apples increase the action of
the kidneys.)</p>

<p><b>Desserts.</b>—Plain puddings, junket, rice, stewed
or fresh fruits.</p>

<p><b>Liquids.</b>—Pure water, toast water, barley water,
butter milk, malted milk, milk.</p>

<p>Eat eggs sparingly and in severe cases, not at all.</p>

<p><b>AVOID.</b>—Alcohol, coffee, tobacco, dried fruits,
nuts, cheese, candies, pastries, pies, spices, rich
puddings, fried foods, vinegar, pickles, lemons, rhubarb,
mushrooms, asparagus, sweet potatoes, tomatoes,

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span></p>
<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Rheumatism.</div>

<p>Since the medical profession is
unable to determine just what
rheumatism is, it is difficult to prescribe a
diet. The theory so long believed that it is
an excess of uric acid in the system is no
longer held by most of the advanced physicians.
Some authorities hold that it is a
nerve difficulty; others that it is an excess
of lactic acid. Some authorities put one
on an entire meat diet, in case of rheumatism,
and others entirely exclude meat.
Uric acid may accompany the disease.</p>

<p>Assuming that it is due to the failure of
the system to promptly eliminate its waste,
whether this failure to eliminate be through
a weakened condition of the nerves, and
the consequent failure to properly direct
the body activities, the correction of the
difficulty must lie in building up the general
vitality and in aiding the system in
its elimination. Hot sweat baths, a free
use of water and a free use of fruits, particularly
the citrous fruits, such as lemons,
oranges, limes, etc., are desirable, because
they increase the alkalinity of the blood.
The acid unites with other acids of the
body acting as a re-agent. Often when the
acids of the stomach are strong, sodium
carbonate (baking soda) produces an alkaline
reaction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span></p>

<p>The diet should be cut down in quantity.
Meat may be eliminated if an excess of
uric acid exists and the above suggestions
under the diet for <em>Gout</em> be followed.</p>

<p>Fruit juices should be used freely because
of their alkaline reaction and because
of their diuretic effect. Lemonade,
orangeade and all fresh fruits and vegetables
are diuretic.</p>

<p>Regular exercises, until the body is
thoroughly heated, deep breathing of
pure air day and night and a copious
drinking of water are necessary.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Uremia or
Uremic
Poisoning</div>

<p>Interference in the action of the
kidneys is apt to result in a retention
within the system of the elements,
which the kidneys, in normal
condition, eliminate from the system, such
as urea, uric acid, urates, sulphuric acid,
sulphates, sodium phosphate, xanthin
bodies and conjugated sulphates. These
substances are not thrown off by the skin,
or by the lungs, and must all be eliminated
through the kidneys. They are the result
of the oxidation and the breaking down of
the proteins of the body. If the kidneys do
not throw these off, the result is Uremic
Poisoning, and the dietetic treatment must
be to cause a free action of the kidneys by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
the use of diuretics. Of these the citrous
fruits, (lemons, oranges, limes, etc.,) are
the best; they neutralize acids and produce
an alkalinity of the blood. They should be
used freely.</p>

<p>Meats, eggs and legumes should be eliminated
from the diet. A free drinking of
water, milk with limewater, cereals, buttermilk,
kumyss, barley water, toast water,
lemonade, orangeade, vegetables and fruit
should constitute the diet. Exercise and
free breathing of fresh air are imperative.
All food should be thoroughly masticated.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Excess of
Uric Acid</div>

<p>An excess of uric acid may not always
cause uremic poisoning, but it
indicates an excess of protein in the
system above the amount eliminated by the
kidneys and the skin. This excess is often
the cause of chronic ailments, such as
bronchitis, asthma, hay-fever, severe nerve
depression, gout, rheumatism, neuralgia,
tonsilitis, grippe, influenza, colds, etc.</p>

<p>The natural relief is to control the diet,
supplying less protein and to increase the
elimination through a free action of the
kidneys, of the pores of the skin, and of
the lungs. Systematic exercise, deep
breathing, a copious drinking of water and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
fresh air day and night, are the best reliefs.</p>

<p>One may either eliminate the proteins
from the diet, or may cut down the entire
quantity of food, and, by exercise, breathing,
a freedom of the pores of the skin and
a free drinking of water, so as to create
an activity of the kidneys, may continuously
eliminate more uric acid than is consumed
in the food.</p>

<p>The regulation of the quantity of the
food, rather than the cutting down of the
proteins and the feeding of a larger proportion
of starches, is the course pursued
where one is inclined to an excess of uric
acid and still has an excess of fat.</p>

<p>In case of an excess of uric acid in thin
persons, such proteins food as meat and
eggs may be eliminated and the diet consist
almost wholly of carbohydrates and
fats.</p>

<p>The diet is the same as that given above
for <em>Gout</em>.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Obesity</div>

<p>All diets for obesity must be prescribed
for the individual condition.
A large number of the obese are
afflicted with rheumatism, sluggish livers,
sluggish action of the intestines and weak<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
nerves, and the diet must be governed accordingly.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>The regulation of food for reduction of
flesh must, also, be governed by age, sex,
by the manner of breathing and by the
amount of daily exercise.</p>

<p>Exercise, breathing and diet are the
scientific means of reduction, the food
must be regulated in accordance with the
quantity of carbohydrates and fats daily
consumed in heat and energy.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Leanness</div>

<p>No definite diet can be given for
flesh building, because a lack of sufficient
fat to round out the figure is due to faulty
digestion or assimilation and the cause
must first be eliminated.</p>

<p>It may be that the strength of the muscles
and nerves of stomach, liver and intestines
must first be built up by exercises
and deep breathing, and it may be that the
habit of nerve relaxation must be established.
Where one’s nerves are tense
much nourishment is consumed in nervous
energy and the nerves to digestive organs
and muscles being tense, interfere with digestion
and assimilation.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span></p>
<p>It is apparent that the cause must first
be corrected, because to overload the digestive
organs with sugars, starches and
fats, further weakens them.</p>

<h3>MEASURES AND WEIGHTS.</h3>


<p>A few tables of measures may be helpful here
because accurate measurements are necessary to
insure success in the preparation of any article of
food.</p>

<p>All dry ingredients, such as flour, meal, powdered
sugar, etc., should be sifted before measuring.</p>

<p>The standard measuring cup contains one-half
pint and is divided into fourths and thirds.</p>

<p>To measure a cupful or spoonful of dry ingredients,
fill the cup or spoon and then level off with
the back of a case-knife.</p>

<p>In measures of weight the gram is the unit.</p>

<p>A “heaping cupful” is a level cup with two tablespoonsful
added.</p>

<p>A “scant cupful” is a level cup with two tablespoonsful
taken out.</p>

<p>A “salt spoon” is one-fourth of a level teaspoon.</p>

<p>To measure butter, lard and other solid foods,
pack solidly in spoon or cup and measure level
with a knife.</p>

</div>


<p>The purpose is not to give below such
receipts as are found in ordinary cook
books, but simply to suggest foods useful
for invalids, for semi-invalids, or for
chronic, abnormal conditions of digestive
organs.</p>


<h3>BEVERAGES.</h3>

<p>Beverages are primarily to relieve
thirst; they may also contain food elements;
they may be used for their effect
in heat and cold; for their flavor which
helps to increase the appetite; or for their
stimulating properties.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p><b>WATER.</b> Pure and carbonated; mineral waters
contain iron, sulphur, lithium, etc.</p>

<p>Hot drinks should be served at a temperature
of from 122 to 140 degrees F. When water is used
as a hot drink it should be freshly drawn, brought
to a boil and used at once. This sterilizes and
develops a better flavor.</p>

<p>Cold water should be thoroughly cooled, but not
iced, unless ice water is sipped very slowly and held
in the mouth until the chill is off. Water is best
cooled by placing the receptacle on ice rather than
by putting ice in the water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>FRUIT JUICES.</b> Under fruit juices are</p>

<p>Grape juice, apple juice,</p>

<p>Currant juice, pineapple juice,</p>

<p>Orangeade and lemonade.</p>

<p>They are especially grateful to fever patients
and are often used to stimulate the appetite. They
are particularly valuable for the acids which they
contain, which stimulate the action of the kidneys
and the peristaltic action of the digestive tract;
they also increase the alkalinity of the blood.</p>

<p>Apples contain malic acid, lemons citric acid
and grapes tartaric acid. The ferment in the ripe
pineapple juice aids in the digestion of proteins.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Lemonade.</b> Wash and wipe a lemon. Cut a
slice from the middle into two pieces to be used
in the garnish before serving; then squeeze the
juice of the rest of the lemon into a bowl, keeping
back the seeds. Add sugar and boiling water; cover
and put on ice to cool; strain and pour into a glass.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Fruit Lemonade.</b> To change and vary the flavor,
fresh fruit of all kinds may be added to strong
lemonade, using boiling water as directed above.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Egg Lemonade.</b> Beat an egg thoroughly, add 2
tablespoonsful of sugar, 2 tablespoonsful of lemon
juice and gradually pour in one cup of cold water.
Stir until smooth and well mixed. Serve thoroughly
cold. This drink is very easily digested, the lemon
having partly digested the egg; 2 tablespoonsful of
sherry or port may be added.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Bran Lemonade.</b> Mix ¼ cup of wheat bran with
2 cups of cold water. Allow this to stand over night
and in the morning add the juice of a lemon.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Pineapple Lemonade.</b> Mix ½ cup of grated pineapple
with the juice of 1 lemon and 2 tablespoonsful
of sugar; add ½ cup of boiling water, put on ice
until cool, then add 1 cup of ice cold water. Strain
and serve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span></p>
<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Grape Lemonade.</b> To one cup of lemonade,
made as directed above, rather sweet, add ½ cup
of grape juice.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Orangeade</b> is prepared as lemonade. The juice
of one sour orange to 2 tablespoonsful of sugar and
½ cup of boiling water is about the right proportion.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Mixed Fruit Drink.</b> Mix ¼ cup of grated pineapple,
the juice of ½ a lemon, the juice of ½ an
orange, 1 cup of boiling water and sugar to taste.
Put on the ice until cool. Strain and add more cold
water and sugar according to taste.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Pineapple Juice.</b> Pour ½ cup of pineapple juice
over crushed ice and serve in a dainty glass. This
is especially helpful in cases of weak digestion and
in some throat troubles—as stated above, the pineapple
aids protein digestion.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Lemon Whey.</b> Heat one cup of milk in a small
sauce pan, over hot water, or in a double boiler.
Add two tablespoonsful of lemon juice; cook without
stirring until the whey separates. Strain
through cheese cloth and add two teaspoons of
sugar. Serve hot or cold. Garnish with small
pieces of lemon.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Wine Whey</b> may be made in the same way, using
¼ cup of sherry wine to 1 cup of hot milk.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Grape Juice, Apple Juice and Currant Juice</b> are
tonics and make a dainty variety for the sick room.
They should be used according to their strength,
usually about ⅓ of juice to ⅔ water. They should
be kept cold and tightly corked until ready to
serve.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Grape Lithia.</b> Add 4 ounces of Lithia water to
1 ounce of grape juice and two teaspoons of sugar.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Grape Nectar.</b> Boil together 1 pound of sugar
and ½ pint of water until it begins to thread. Remove
from the fire and when cool add the juice
of 6 lemons and one quart of grape juice. Let stand
over night. Serve with ice water, Apollinaris, or
plain soda water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Tea Punch.</b> Pour boiling lemonade, sweetened
to taste, over tea leaves. Allow the liquid to stand
until cool. Then strain and serve with shaved ice
and slices of lemon. This makes a delicious cooling
drink for hot weather.</p>
</div>


<h3>LIQUID FOODS.</h3>

<p>Under this heading such liquids are
given as are actual foods.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p><b>MILK.</b> Milk is a complete food and a perfect
food for infants, but not a perfect food for adults. It
may be used as</p>

<p>Whole or skimmed;</p>

<p>Peptonized; boiled;</p>

<p>Sterilized, pasteurized;</p>

<p>Milk with lime water, Vichy or Apollinaris;</p>

<p>With equal parts of farinaceous liquids;</p>

<p>Albuminized milk with white of egg;</p>

<p>Milk with egg yolk, flavored with vanilla, cinnamon
or nutmeg;</p>

<p>Milk flavored with coffee, cocoa, or meat broth;</p>

<p>Milk punch; milk lemonade;</p>

<p>Koumiss; kefir or whey, with lemon juice, as
above.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>EGG PREPARATIONS</b>. These consist of</p>

<p>Albumin water (diluted white of egg), flavored
with fruit juice;</p>

<p>Egg lemonade; egg orangeade;</p>

<p>Egg with meat broth;</p>

<p>Egg with coffee and milk;</p>

<p>Chocolate eggnog.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span></p>

<p>Often the white of egg, dissolved in water or
milk, is given when the yolk cannot be digested,
because of the amount of fat which the yolk contains.</p>

<p>Where one is inclined to billiousness, the egg
is better digested if beaten in wine.</p>

<p>The albuminous or egg drinks are best prepared
cold.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Eggnog.</b> To make eggnog, separate the white
and the yolk, beat the yolk with ¾ of a tablespoonful
of sugar and a speck of salt until creamy.
Add ¾ of a cup of milk and 1 tablespoonful of
brandy. Beat the white until foamy, add to the
above mixture and serve immediately. A little nutmeg
may be substituted for the brandy. The eggs
and milk should be chilled before using. Eggnog
is very nutritious.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Egg Broth.</b> Beat the yolk of 1 egg, add 1 tablespoonful
of sugar and a speck of salt. Add 1 cup
of hot milk and pour it on gradually. Flavor with
nutmeg.</p>

<p>Dried and rolled bread crumbs may be added,
or beef, mutton or chicken broth may be used in
place of the milk, and the sugar may be omitted.
The whole egg may be used if desired.</p>

<p>This is very delicious made with beef broth,
instead of hot milk. Pineapple juice or coffee may
be used.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Coffee Eggnog.</b> 1 egg, 1¼ teaspoons of sugar,
½ scant cup of milk or cream, ½ scant cup of
coffee.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Egg Malted Milk.</b> Mix 1 tablespoonful of Horlick’s
Malted Milk with 1 tablespoonful of crushed
fruit and 1 egg; beat for five minutes. Strain and
add 20 drops of acid phosphate, 1 tablespoonful of
crushed ice and ¾ cup of ice water. A grating of
nutmeg may be used for flavor.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Grape Yolk.</b> Separate the white and the yolk
of an egg, beat the yolk, add the sugar and let the
yolk and sugar stand while the white of the egg is
thoroughly whipped. Add two tablespoonsful of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
grape juice to the yolk and pour this on to the
beaten white, blending carefully. Have all ingredients
chilled before blending and serve cold.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Albuminized Milk.</b> Beat ½ cup of milk and the
white of one egg with a few grains of salt. Put
into a fruit jar, shake thoroughly until blended.
Strain into a glass and serve cold.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Albumin Water.</b> Albumin water is used chiefly
for infants in cases of acute stomach and intestinal
disorders, in which some nutritious and easily assimilated
food is needed. The white of 1 egg is dissolved
in a pint of water, which has been boiled and
cooled.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Albuminized Grape Juice.</b> Put two tablespoonsful
of grape juice into a dainty glass with pure
chopped ice. Beat the white of one egg, turn into
the glass, sprinkle a little sugar over the top and
serve.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>FARINACEOUS BEVERAGES.</b> These are all
made by slowly adding cereals, such as barley, rice,
oatmeal, etc., to a large quantity of boiling water and
cooking from two to three hours and then straining
off the liquid and seasoning to taste. They are particularly
valuable when only a small amount of
nutriment can be assimilated. Since the chief ingredient
is starch, long cooking is necessary to make
soluble the starch globules and to change the
starch into dextrin, so that it can be more readily
digested. Since these drinks are given only in case
of weak digestion, it is important that they be taken
slowly and held in the mouth until they are thoroughly
mixed with the saliva.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Barley Water.</b> (Infant feeding). Mix 1 teaspoonful
of barley flour with two tablespoonsful of
cold water, until it is a smooth paste. Put in the
top of a double boiler and add gradually one pint
of boiling water. Boil over direct heat five minutes,
stirring constantly; then put into a double
boiler, over boiling water, and cook fifteen minutes
longer. This is used as a diluent with normal
infants and to check diarrhoea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span></p>

<p>For children or adults use ½ teaspoonful of
barley or rice flour, 1 cup of boiling water and ¼
teaspoonful of salt. Cream or milk and salt may
be added for adults, or, lemon juice and sugar,
according to the condition.</p>

<p>Barley water is an astringent and used to check
the bowels when they are too laxative.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Rice Water.</b> Wash two tablespoonsful of rice,
add 3 cups of cold water and soak thirty minutes.
Then heat gradually and cook one hour until the
rice is tender. Strain through muslin, re-heat and
dilute with boiling water or hot milk to the consistency
desired. Season with salt; sugar may be
added if desired and cinnamon, if allowed, may be
cooked with it to assist in reducing a laxative condition.
1 teaspoonful of stoned raisins may be
added to the rice, before boiling, if there is no bowel
trouble.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Oatmeal Water.</b> Mix 1 tablespoonful of oatmeal
with 1 tablespoonful of cold water. Add a
speck of salt and stir into it a quart of boiling
water. Boil for three hours, replenishing the water
as it boils away. Strain through a fine sieve or
cheese cloth, season and serve cold. Sufficient water
should be added to keep the drink almost as thin
as water.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Toast Water.</b> Toast thin slices of stale bread
in the oven; break up into crumbs; add 1 cup of
boiling water and let it stand for an hour. Rub
through a fine strainer, season with a little salt.
Milk, or cream and sugar may be added if desirable.
This is valuable in cases of fever or extreme
nausea.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Crust Coffee.</b> Dry crusts of brown bread in the
oven until they are hard and crisp. Pound or roll
them and pour boiling water over. Let soak for
fifteen minutes, then strain carefully through a fine
sieve.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Meat Juice.</b> Meat juice may be prepared in
three ways:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span></p>

<p>(1) Broil quickly, or even scorch, a small piece
of beef. Squeeze out the juice with a lemon
squeezer, previously dipped in boiling water. Catch
the juice in a hot cup. Season and serve. If desirable
to heat it further, do so by placing the cup
in hot water.</p>

<p>(2) Broil quickly and put the small piece into
a glass jar. Set the covered jar in a pan of cold
water. Heat gradually for an hour, never allowing
the water to come to a boil. Strain and press
out the clear, red juice, season and serve. One
pound of beef yields eight tablespoonsful of juice.</p>

<p>(3) Grind raw beef in a meat grinder; place
in a jar with a light cover and add one gill of cold
water to a pound of beef. Stand it on ice over
night, strain and squeeze through a bag. Season
and serve.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Meat Tea.</b> Meat tea is made in the proportion
of a pound of meat to a pint of water. Grind the
meat in the meat grinder, place in a jar and cover
with cold water. Set the jar in an open kettle of
water and cook for two hours or more, not allowing
the water to boil. Strain, squeeze through a bag,
skim off the fat and season.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Meat Broth.</b> Meat broth is made from meat and
bone, with and without vegetables. The proportion
is a quart of water to a pound of meat. Cut the
meat into small pieces, add the cold water and
simmer until the quantity is reduced one-half.
Strain, skim and season with salt. Chicken, veal,
mutton and beef may be used in this way. They
may be seasoned with onions, celery, bay-leaves,
cloves, carrots, parsnips, rice, barley, tapioca; stale
bread crumbs may be added.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Soups.</b> Clear soups are made by cooking raw
meat or vegetables, or both together, slowly, for a
long time, straining and using the liquid. The
flavor may be changed by browning the meat or
vegetables in butter before adding the water.</p>

<p>Cream Soups are made in the proportion of one
quart of vegetables, (such as corn, peas, beans, tomatoes,
celery or asparagus) to one pint of water
and a pint of milk. Cook the vegetables thoroughly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
in water and mash through a colander. To this
water and pulp add a cream sauce made in the proportion
of 4 tablespoonsful of flour, 4 tablespoonsful
of butter and a pint of milk for vegetables poor
in starch or protein. Add 2 tablespoonsful of flour,
2 tablespoonsful of butter and a pint of milk for
those rich in protein. Season to taste.</p>

<p>Tomato acid should be counteracted by the addition
of one-eighth tablespoonful of soda before
the milk is added.</p>

<p>Potato soup may be flavored with onion or
celery, or both.</p>

<h3>SEMI-SOLID FOODS.</h3>

<p><b><span class="allsmcap">JELLIES.</span></b> <b>Meat Jellies</b> are made in two
ways:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>(1) Cook soup meat (containing gristle and
bone) slowly for a long time in just enough water
to cover. Strain and set the liquid away in a
mold to cool and set. If desired, bits of shredded
meat may be added to the liquid before molding.</p>

<p>(2) Use meat broth and gelatin in the proportion
of one tablespoon gelatin to three quarters of
a cup of hot broth. Pour into mold and set on ice.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Starch Jellies.</b>—Starch Jellies are made by cooking
in a pint of fruit juice or water until clear, two
tablespoons of tapioca, arrowroot, sago, cornstarch,
or flour. Sweeten to taste.</p>

<p>If water is used, fresh fruit may be used either
in the jelly or in a sauce poured over the jelly.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Fruit Jellies.</b>—These are made:</p>

<p>(1) Of fruit juice and sugar in equal quantities,
cooked until it will set when cooled;</p>

<p>(2) Of fruit juice and gelatin in the proportion
of one tablespoon of gelatin to three fourths of a cup
of fruit juice, or one half box gelatin to one and a
half pints of juice. Sugar to taste. Made tea or
coffee, or cocoa or lemonade may be used in the
same proportion.</p>
</div>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b><span class="allsmcap">CUSTARDS.</span></b>—These are made with (1)
milk, (2) milk and eggs, (3) milk, egg and
some farinaceous substances as rice, cornstarch,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
tapioca. In the first the coagulum
is produced by the addition of rennet, in
the other two by the application of heat.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p><b>Plain Junket.</b>—Dissolve in a cup of lukewarm
milk (never warmer), a tablespoon of sugar or
caramel syrup. Add a quarter of a junket tablet,
previously dissolved in a tablespoon of cold water.
Stir a few times, add vanilla, nuts, or nutmeg if
desired. Pour into a cup and set aside to cool and
solidify. This may be served plain or with whipped
cream, or boiled custard.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Egg-Milk Custard.</b>—When eggs are used for
thickening, not less than four eggs should be used
to a quart of milk (more eggs make it richer).</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Boiled Custard.</b>—One pint of milk, two eggs, half
cup of sugar, half saltspoon of salt. Scald the milk,
add the salt and sugar, and stir until dissolved.
Beat the eggs very thick and smooth. Pour the
boiling milk on the eggs slowly, stirring all the
time. Pour the mixture into a double boiler, set
over the fire and stir for ten minutes. Add flavoring.
As soon as a thickening of the mixture is
noticed remove from the fire, pour into a dish and
set away to cool. This custard makes <b>cup custard</b>,
the sauce for such puddings as <b>snow pudding</b>, and
when decorated with spoonfuls of beaten egg-white,
makes <b>floating island</b>.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Baked Custard.</b>—Proceed as in boiled custard,
but instead of pouring into a double boiler pour
into a baking dish. Set the dish in a pan of water,
place in the oven and bake until the mixture is set
in the middle.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Farinaceous Custards.</b>—Make like boiled custard,
using one less egg and adding one quarter cup
of farina, tapioca, cornstarch, arrowroot, or cooked
rice to the hot milk and egg.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Sago</b> should be soaked over night before using.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Tapioca</b> should be soaked one hour before using.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Coffee Custard.</b>—Scald one tablespoon of ground
coffee in milk and strain before proceeding as for
boiled custard.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Chocolate Custard.</b>—Add one square of grated
chocolate to the milk.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Caramel Custard.</b>—Melt the dry sugar until
golden brown, add the hot milk, and when dissolved
proceed as before. Bake.</p>
</div>

<p><b><span class="allsmcap">GRUELS.</span></b>—Gruels are a mixture of grain
or flour with either milk or water. They
require long cooking and may be flavored
with sugar, nutmeg, cinnamon, or almond.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>Take the meal or flour (oatmeal, two tablespoons,
or cornmeal, one tablespoon, or arrowroot, one and
a half tablespoons). Sift it slowly into one and a
half cups boiling water, simmer for an hour or
two. Strain off the liquid; add to it one teaspoon
of sugar, season with salt, and add one cup of warm
milk.</p>

<p><b>Water Gruel.</b>—If water gruel is desired, let the
last cup of liquid added be water instead of milk.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Cream Gruel.</b>—A cream gruel may be made by
using rich cream instead of milk or water.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Barley Gruel.</b>—Barley gruel (usually a water
gruel) is prepared as follows: Moisten four tablespoons
of barley flour in a little cold water and
add it slowly to the boiling water. Stir and boil
for twenty minutes.</p>

<p><b>TOASTS.</b>—<b>Cream Toast.</b>—Toast the bread slowly
until brown on both sides. Butter and pour
over each slice enough warm cream to moisten (the
cream may be thickened slightly and the butter
may be omitted.)</p>

<p><b>Milk Toast.</b>—One tablespoon of cornstarch or
flour; one cup of milk, salt to taste, and boil. Butter
the toast and pour over it the above white sauce.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Water Toast.</b>—Pour over plain or buttered toast
enough boiling water to thoroughly moisten it.</p>
</div>


<p><b><span class="allsmcap">SOUFFLES OF FRUIT, ETC.</span></b>—The distinguishing
feature of a souffle is a pastry or
pulpy foundation mixture, and the addition
of stiffly beaten egg-white. A souffle
may or may not be baked.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p><b>Plain Souffle.</b>—Two tablespoons flour; one cup
of liquid (water, milk, or fruit juice); three or four
eggs; sugar to suit the fruit. If thick fruit pulp is
used, omit the thickening. Beat the egg yolks until
thick. Add sugar gradually and continue beating.
Add the fruit (if lemon juice add some rind also).
Fold in the well-beaten whites. Bake in a buttered
dish (set in a pan of hot water) for thirty-five or
forty minutes in a slow oven.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Fresh Fruit Souffle.</b>—Reduce the fruit to a pulp.
Strawberries, peaches, prunes, apples, bananas, etc.,
may be used. Sweeten the pulp. Beat the egg-white
to a stiff froth, add the fruit pulp slowly.
Chill and serve with whipped cream or soft custard.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Chocolate Souffle.</b>—Two tablespoons flour; two
tablespoons butter; three quarters cup of milk; one
third cup of sugar: two tablespoons hot water. Melt
the butter, add the flour and stir well. Pour the
milk in gradually and cook until well boiled. Add
the melted chocolate, to which the sugar and hot
water have been added. Beat in the yolks and fold
in the whites of the eggs. Bake twenty-five minutes.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>Farina Souffle.</b>—Cook the farina (four tablespoons)
in a pint of boiling water. Stir this with
the egg-yolks, add sugar or salt, and later fold in
the egg-whites, flavor, and set away to cool.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span></p>

<p>The following tables are from “Food
and Dietetics,” (Norton), published by
the American School of Home Economics,
Chicago. They are used in a number of
schools of Domestic Science and in Dietetic
kitchens in hospitals.</p>

<p>These tables are exceptionally valuable
in compiling diets in various combinations.
One readily determines the number of
grams in various servings of different
foods. For example—a small serving of
beef (round), containing some fat, weighs
36 grams; forty per cent; 14.4 grams, is
protein, and sixty per cent, 21.6 grams, is
fat, (no carbohydrates). One ordinary
thick slice of white, home made bread
weighs 38 grams; thirteen per cent, 4.94
grams, is protein, six per cent 2.28 grams
is fat and eighty-one per cent, 30.78 grams,
is carbohydrate.</p>

<p>One can readily make up the proportions
of proteins, carbohydrates and fats
required by the average individual suggested
on pages 217-218 from various combinations
of foods. Each individual may
make this study for himself to know
whether his system is receiving too much
in quantity, or too large a proportion of
proteins or of carbohydrates or of fats.</p>
